    <p><i>9:48pm</i>. I’m a little intoxicated, not gonna lie. So what if it’s not even10pm andit’s a Tuesday night? What? The Kirkland facebook isopen on my computer desktop and some of these people have pretty horrendous facebook pics.I almost want to put some of these faces next to pictures of farm animals and have peoplevote on which is more attractive. It’s not such a great idea and probably not evenfunny, butBilly comes up with the idea of comparing two people from the facebook, and onlysometimes putting a farm animal in there. Good call Mr. Olson! I think he’s onto something.
