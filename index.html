    <h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 1- 1st January, Sunday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>18:40: </b></ins></i> Almost finished the website templates. Started in the morning continued with my taking notes for html then eventually started coding, although a lot of work needs to be done.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>19:00: </b></ins></i>I should stop this website thing and start reading some blogs</p>
<p><i><ins><b>20:29: </b></ins></i> I watched a Shark Tank episode just to feed the mind, but this is not good. It has to stop. I am thinking of reading today rather <br> than starting DSA/CP as it will all be in a loop when I come to college.
    <p><i><ins>Things accomplished: </ins></i><br>
    <ul>
    <li>Thought out the structure of website and coded it</li>
    <li>Read <a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/productivity">Sam altman's blog on productivity</a>along with his blogs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is the first day of 2023 and I have lot of new ideas which I plan to apply on myself but it's all about execution.</p>
    </p>


    <h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 2- 2nd January, Monday</i></h3>
    <p><i><ins><b>6:16: </b></ins></i> Just sat at my laptop, woke up at around 5:45, had some tea. I need to think of something to work on. Probably I'll summarise<br> articles that I read yesterday. </p>
 <p><i><ins><b>6:34: </b></ins></i> Just tried meditating a bit, it is so difficult to keep it still....</p>
<p><i><ins><b>7:10: </b></ins></i>Summarising Sam altman's blog on <a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/productivity">How to be successful</a> </p>
 <p><i><ins><b>7:10: </b></ins></i> This is taking a lot of time. Need to drop it now because it is all about execution. </p>
     <p><i><ins><b>7:50: </b></ins></i> Started with SQL from Gfg and W3. Anish texted to connect today for that SQL task. It was not free of distractions <br>
         wathed YT shorts in b/w and checked WA. Well!, it is a shame though.  </p>
      <p><i><ins><b>10:50: </b></ins></i> Connected with Anish but couldn't share screen as task was pending. Immediately after that had DPIT meet nothing <br>
          special though just discussion on design impacts if both portrait and landscape mode allowed. </p>
      <p><i><ins><b>10:50: </b></ins></i> Watched movie "Sonchiriya"for 1hr or so. </p>
      <p><i><ins><b>13:30: </b></ins></i> Continued with SQL along with my guilt of watching with the movie. </p>
      <p><i><ins><b>13:50: </b></ins></i> Bathed and had my lunch along with brief chat with Mom. </p>
      <p><i><ins><b>14:30: </b></ins></i> Read newspaper and went outside to fetch Redhu bhaiya's blanket. </p>
      <p><i><ins><b>16:40: </b></ins></i> I have to shut this laptop along with close to 200 tabs uff..... as time for train is approaching. </p>
      <p><i><ins><b>17:30: </b></ins></i> Done with cleaing of laptop, have to immediately shut it down, otherwise I will miss my train. While closing the tabs, <br>
 I realised that I have developed a very bad habit of keeping them open thinking, I will read them after. Even if I read it then also I don't close it. Probably I <br> need to learn how to let things go. Also it shows my diverse distractions/ interests that I have developed over time from corporate, business, case study, tech, <br>
biographies, documentaries. It is very easy to get exposure over lot of things but actual thing is going deep which requires PERSISTENCE, a skill which I definitely <br>need to develop. It is very easy to touch upon up until the time, it is interesting and then dropping it ALTOGETHER. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>18:40: </b></ins></i>I am but annoyed as MOM forced me wear a jacket over hoodie, it makes me uncomfortale. Train has arrived, it is probably time to<br> leave HISAR for good. In the train met this BSF jawan(a.k.a SardarJi), smiling and probably saw Yogesh Nain standing on the station but didn't find time to talk.</p>


<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 3- 3nd January, Tuesday</i></h3>
<p>Will update soon. </p>



   <h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 4- 4th January, Wednesday</i></h3>
   <p><i><ins><b>7:40: </b></ins></i> Going to eat my breakfast. Woke up at 5:40. Read the Inter IIT PS then prepared the deck. Basically searched the PM school decks<br> because it would have taken a lot of time otherwise.</p>
   <p><i><ins><b>8:50: </b></ins></i> Now I plan to do that design of cleanliness part as I have to go to class at 9. Wanted to go in 1st class but Ankur said<br>
  he doesn't take attendance so dropped it.</p>    
   <p><i><ins><b>8:50: </b></ins></i> I had to leave now for my transportation class. Couldn't update much,  as travelling back to college.Will update after class</p>
   <p><i><ins><b>10:20: </b></ins></i> Just came back from class, Prof was good. Now I plan to update this and then probably check my SQl work, if it is working fine.</p>
 <p><i><ins><b>10:40: </b></ins></i>Just heard back from Anish regarding that SQL work, so will probably have meeting in second half. So technically I am free,will<br> do some questions on CF. </p>
 <p><i><ins><b>13:20: </b></ins></i>Feeling a bit drowsy, had my food at 12:20, fixed that SQL work to make it presentable. But the meeting with Anish blew off.</p>
 <p><i><ins><b>14:10: </b></ins></i> My solution got accepted, I probably have to rush for my lab class now. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>17:10: </b></ins></i> Just got back from the lab. It seemed a complete time waste, NOC work was also not done. Bonafide certificate I gave and also<br>
verified the mess application status, it was also pending. Now on the room no one is there and I don't have the keys. My hand gloves also got lost in lab. Uff...<br>the PAIN is never ending.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>6:40: </b></ins></i> Shit man now the sockets stopped working. I am dozing off for an hour from 17:40. Seems it would be fixed anytime soon so I am <br>in the library. It seems so good here.</p>
 <p><i><ins><b>21:43: </b></ins></i> I am feeling super hungry, probably have to leave library now, it seems I won't be able to do this CF question. Also just updated<br> the few portions above.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>21:43: </b></ins></i> Starting out with SQL now. Just had my breakfast chatted with Darshan, a bit.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>23:45: </b></ins></i> Time to sleep guys, brain has stpped working now.</p>


<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 5- 5th January, Thrusday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>5:35: </b></ins></i>I am back with a bang. Got up at 5:10, mediatated a little. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>12:25: </b></ins></i> Started with the COMMON mistakes video of Utkarsh Gupta then participated in Virtual Contest of Jan 3. Just stuck on this <br>question, figured out the logic fast. Just trying again and again, shouldn't have done that. Frustrated had to leave for breakfast. Came back tried B immediately <br>got away with logic, solved it. feeling a bit relaxed.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>12:25: </b></ins></i> Feeling very hungry. Wanted to go to mess immediately after lab but the food was not ready so thought of updating the website.<br>But just chatting, giving placement gyan seemed a waste of time though. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>17:15: </b></ins></i>I had to immediately rush to collect mini draft and chart paper for the graph. Luckily didn't have to run much Tanmay gave the mini<br> draft and Saurav arranged the graph paper. Lab was at the same place where CE-205 laboratory was there. No one had any clue regarding how to use the drafter<br> but with time, got a hold of it. NOC is still not prepared but hopefully it is made and I am happy about it. <br>
Now feeling a bit wore off but will probably start with the reviewing previously done questions.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>19:45: </b></ins></i>DPIT meeting is going on, just got up from sleeping. I should have slept after coming from lab, it would have been more productive<br>. I am waiting for the meeting to end and do the contest, I hope it increases a bit. I just need to stay calm and give output in contest. 
<br> WILL UPDATE AFTER THE CONTEST FINGERS CROSSED.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>21:45: </b></ins></i> All the excitement is gone, I am crushed and shattered. Kind of feeling sorry for my parents who had invested in me. Couldn't<br> solve even 2 questions. Need to step up the game to next level if I had to turn things around, otherwise it is over. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>21:45: </b></ins></i>Started with further topics of time and space complexity, NO ONE IS GOING TO HELP YOU SO STAND UP FOR YOURSELF. </p>


<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 6- 6th January, Friday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>5:40: </b></ins></i>Got up on time, continued with my space time complexity, but I do feel I am giving lot of time to it than it deserve, maybe I <br>should try to finish it fast. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>10:45: </b></ins></i>I am just sitting for my study session, although not very enthusiastic for opening codeforces. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>10:45: </b></ins></i>Meeting with ANISH just got over, he liked the work and will share another dataset before 1 PM probably. Not feeling very <br> prouductive today tbh. But it is not the solution anyways. Time to work super hard guys.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>13:30: </b></ins></i> Started with STL so as to remove roadblocks, if I want to use some stuff. ALSO changed the bed settings a little bit, brought <br>the quilt. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>17:03: </b></ins></i>JUST came back after meeting explo supervisor Supriya Mam. We have been asked to make a web application having soil profile on <br>location basis. She explained a little bit about it, and we have been asked to read a research paper and update her on every Friday after 4. Although I expected <br>ML project but even web dev is OK as both are impactless. ALSO rushed back again to fetch NOC. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>17:03: </b></ins></i> Wasted a little bit time on YT Shorts, had my food sitting back for another study session. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>22:05: </b></ins></i> Time to sleep, didn't feel like productive at the moment.</p>


<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 7- 7th January, Saturday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>4:45: </b></ins></i> Woke up at 4:05, meditated a little and planned for the day, I hope make it most prouductive as weekends are crucial.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>4:30: </b></ins></i>Got up at around 4:05, ideated a bit and brushed the teeth. Started with the time space complexity then quickly switched<br>STL playlist of LUV, however deviated a little bit seeing SIXER's last episode in 2x. It was not feeling I was very productive, I don't know why.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>13:53: </b></ins></i>Came back after having food. Feeling a bit less productive, need to double down. Party in SATKAR today hosted by Ajay bhaiya VP<br>. Student Gymkhana.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>14:45: </b></ins></i>Meeting for DPIT is about to get over, they are discussing some of the security vulnerabilities of the app, didn't thought there<br> are so many to break the app. Anyways would have been better if I had got it in First year, feeling a bit pressuried. I would have learned much more but it is ok.<br>
I actually found the course of GFG on the online folder shared by senior need to </p>
<p><i><ins><b>19:00: </b></ins></i>I am absolutely not feeling okay, was not able to solve this CF question and this mega folder also created problems. It has max <br>limit of 5 GB per day. Downloaded the opera browser for it's VPN but of no use. It is simply a waste of time. I don't know if I should purchase this course.<br>It's time to go to Haryana group party.</p>


<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 8- 8th January, Sunday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>11:42: </b></ins></i>OMG!! couldn't explain in words what happended yesterday night. We went to LC and almost everyone was there already. I met this<br>from CSE Siddharth from Tosham and he from Harshdeep's family surprisingly. Seemed a decent good guy. Talked on various topics, felt good. We went to Satkar <br> and eveyone sat at this table. INITIALLY started with cold drink, I obviously wanted to try for the first time. So started with little bit of Blender's Pride<br>neat, taste seemed absolutely normal and then poured more and more. After that OLD MONK, it was something very different and strong. I started feeling a <br>odd but I was still in my senses so went on and ON as no one was there to stop me. I should have stopped after that. AFter that it went off and litreally made<br>me mad. I don't remember most of the things but I didn't have my dinner and was sitting most of time outside on chair puking. It was hell of experience.</p>
<p>Then I don't remember much just people supporting me to walk and lick lemon but nothing worked. It not only wasted my time but I am still not well, maybe because<br>I have eaten nothing. I am still not in all my senses. I need to recover all of this. I need to have my lunch, maybe it will make me feel better.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>13:30: </b></ins></i>Just came back from mess, throwed away most of the food. Felt like vomitting. Talked with Dhruv and Geetesh regarding the TPR's<br>interview shit.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>17:42: </b></ins></i>I think it is the most unproductive day of the year till now, on contrary it should be most productive.Didn't accomplish a shit <br> in the whole day. Will probably give contest at 8 though.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>10:42: </b></ins></i>The contest is over. Could solve only one. 2nd one was special one, not logical just pattern based. Most of them couldn't solve.</p>
<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 9- 9th January, Monday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>5:50: </b></ins></i>Ankit's alarm rang, completely disturbed my sleep. Asked him to stop it, then slept again for another 20 mins. Finally got up at<br>at around 6. Changed my CF handle to Mum and dad's name. Solved a question, saw other's answer's to it and it was so overwhelming to see well scripted answers with <br>lot less complexity.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>10:30: </b></ins></i>Well, the week starts with a bang. Today is relativley least workload day of the week. Just came back from class of Ramadu Sir<br>Just have one more class of Biochem, infact first class of biochem.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>15:10: </b></ins></i>Just came back from BIOCHEM class, seemed very humble and nice guy. I don't know about the syllabus and stuff but I think it would <br>be good time. Now I am thinking of submitting that CF question !!</p>
<p><i><ins><b>19:10: </b></ins></i>Just a bit exhausted after this session. Probably spent whole time on problems, but from the output prespective, I don't think<br>it was productive. Started off with 1000 rating questions, couldn't solve them with that ease, also they were consuming a lot of time. Changed topics to simple "Implementation"<br>and rating to be 900. Starte from bottom solved 2, changed the order and started with moved up, which was a mistake tbh. I should have gone<br>with same order.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>19:50: </b></ins></i>Saw few people collecting mess receipts. So for refund gave it downstairs in the office. I don't want any problems this semester<br>my last semester's refund is also pending due to my own mistake. Time to eat !!!.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>21:23: </b></ins></i>Read some Russia Ukraine news, I think now it's time to do that INVEST INDIA task. It was given on Saturday and I haven't touched<br>it yet. I am thinking of presenting it tomorrow.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>00:00: </b></ins></i>It's time to sleep, a bit tired though. It is actually boring task to segregate this type of data Statewise. I am stuck on this<br> error "Cannot obtain the required interface ("IID_IColumnsInfo") from OLE DB provider "BULK" for linked server "(null)", can't solve it. I tried everything available <br> on the web but still couldn't figure it out.</p>


<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 10- 10th January, Tuesday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>5:40: </b></ins></i>Woke up, uneccessarily alarm rang completely disturbing my sleep. I continued with the last night's work. Almost completed with<br>state segregation. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>7:20: </b></ins></i >I am done with it. Feeling a little sleepy. Thinking of taking a nap, then after waking up take breakfast and go to 2 hr strucural class.<br>. I will be attending it for the first time.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>10:20: </b></ins></i> Just came back from the structural class. It seemed very easy, all the questions that were given to solve. Basic stuff that was<br> asked to solve in first semester,it's just a continuation of that. Prof seems dilligent to some extent interactive with very poor handwriting on board. Sarthak was giving answers in class but it is easy stuff, I just need to ace the exams, learn from my mistakes from last class and improvise on them because that's what brillant <br>engineers do and I want to be one of them. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>11:20: </b></ins></i>Trimmed my hair, brushed and bathed- all of this takes around 1hr !!. It's refreshing though. I need to ask Anish for the meeting <br>time to share my problem. By that time I should just complete the remaining work left.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>13:20: </b></ins></i>Suggested 12:30 for the meeting as I complteted it by 12 then had my lunch and had the meeting. He told me not to hurry that much.<br> and contact back after coming back from college to do some of the report work. Searched Qala to watch online I now need to rush to Ramadu's class.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>16:00: </b></ins></i>Just came back from classes. I should have left Devender's sir class to proxy. Had tea kachori in between and purchased bananas in between. Now I am thinking of doing CP otherwise streak would be broken. Watched "Qala" for around 30-40 mins or so.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>21:46: </b></ins></i>Lot of time has got wasted got up at 19:10 to refresh my mind as all the questions were giving TLE. Met Suyash outside, asked me to <br>explain the TPR interview process, simply waste of time. Then had to take drafter from Mihir to rushed to 6th floor but he was not there in the room, was just <br> going towards lift thought to meet Prateek regarding inter IIT but spent too much time there. Lot of undeserving people got into inter IIT. He was worried about his <br> intern. Then had dinner and spent some time in Sarthak's room, went there to ask for assignment though. I am thinking of sleeping now, don't feel like doing <br>anything.</p>


<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 11- 11th January, Wednesday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>5:27: </b></ins></i>Huh! just starting out to complete my CE-231(Transportation) assigment, otherwise it would be too late. Mom is also coming to visit <br> me today, feeling happy though. I need to do a lot of work today. Woke up at around 4:15, meditated a little, then started reading Doglapan for half an hour.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>8:47: </b></ins></i> I think it took me a lot of time to complete it, could be done in much more optimised way if time was less. Complete waste of time. <br>I barely completed it tbh. Mom's call came around 8 but suggested to go to college as it might take her some time to get back. I need to rush now as I already missed<br>my first class. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>11:30: </b></ins></i> Just returned from classes after biochem. Immediately called mum, that I am back.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>13:45: </b></ins></i> We talked this whole time but I need to leave now to have lunch and go to geo-tech lab. It felt nice. She will probably visit<br> Devender Sir. I collected my ladoos and gajarpak from her, Ummmm. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>16:10: </b></ins></i> Just got back from lab and luckily I didn't have the copy with plane white pages, but I still got the attendance. I think of roaming outside the campus with her, probably Assi ghat.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>19:10: </b></ins></i> Dropped mom, and got back. I need to urgently go to bathroom. Had to deal with some TPC stuff now. It might get out of hand.<br>Talked with Ankit reagrding the matter. Then moved to Satvik's room, I don't know why.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>21:10: </b></ins></i> Had my dinner.Came back to room, need to do some submissions otherwise streak will be broken.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>23:40: </b></ins></i> Dozing off</p>


<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 12- 12th January, Friday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>5:40: </b></ins></i> Just got up, brushed and meditated a little. I need to get down to this SQL work, that has been pending. This error wasted tons of <br> my time.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>7:40: </b></ins></i> Started at around 6, very slow initially then ramped up. Just got over with it. I am just going to have my breakfast.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>8:50: </b></ins></i> Need to rush to class rn. Just updated the website for yesterday and today.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>12:45: </b></ins></i> Came back from a class and lab, had my lunch and collected my Inter IIT tracksuits, feeling good though wearing it. Last task on <br>my mind is giving Datshin those icons but probably I will give it to him after coming back from another lab. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>14:10: </b></ins></i>Just tried to study a little bit, although not very much focussed.</p>
<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 14- 14th January, Saturday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>8:50: </b></ins></i> Got up today at 5 or so, although was supposed to get up at 3:45 but it was way too early and I was probably feeling quite grumpy at <br>that time. Just walked a little bit, stomach was also unwell. Decided what I need to accomplish today. Started with reading some blogs on CFs then started with <br>the question.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>10:50: </b></ins></i> Got up to have my breakfast otherwise it would be too late Tried questions, although not very successful, did some wrong submissions.<br>Got back and continued the grind but this time it was much less productive, feeling a bit sleey. There is this informal meet with first yearites, I am <br>thinking of attending.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>12:50: </b></ins></i> That meet thing was a big mistake, I should have never got there. It was a big mistake, just felt embarressed and insignificant<br> there from other batchmates. Best thing would have been came back after drinking tea. Also got my lunch in between, it was really nice.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>16:03: </b></ins></i> After that continued with the questions, but after doing it for 1 hour started yt video of Luv. Then attended the DPIT meet,<br>  nothing much for me. Slept for around 30 mins in between. Just updated the website. Now I am thinking of getting back to youtube.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>11:58: </b></ins></i> Just came back from Mohan's Birthday party. Went there around 8 and returned around 11. It is actually a waste of time initially <br> due to deciding of place and how to go or wait for someone who is stuck somewhere. Overall it was good. Need to recover this time tomorrow. I also had this interview<br>planned with Utkarsh bhaiya but it was not possible as I would have to miss the food. Also I have to throw a little bit of gazarpak given by mom,felt<br>.very bad about it. I am going to sleep now as I wasted time watching documnetary, I don't know why these things happen. It just pisses me off.</p>


<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 15- 15th January, Sunday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>6:30: </b></ins></i>F man just woke up. Alarm was for 5:00, Idk how it is repeating, happened yesterday also. Anyways, nothing can be done now. Just had <br>to rush to bathroom, strolled a little in the corridor. Started with the Luv's playlist because there are endless questions, that can be solved all day, but<br> learning must go on as not much time is left and being from a non-circuital branch puts me different position.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>12:05: </b></ins></i>Feeling hungry. It was ok, except in between watched this National Geographic documentary for half an hour or so. Just continued<br> with the playlist. Contest is also there today, so will do some questions, at that time.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>16:40: </b></ins></i> Slept for some time, for around 25-30 mins. Woke up, bathed brushed made bed and laced my shoes. Took around 2 hours. It is good <br> that I watched the contest timings. Less people have registered. I was just texting to some seniors for biz interviews.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>17:29: </b></ins></i> Just came back from canteen. Contest is about to start in 5-6 minutes. I dropped my 100/- in the room, almost shit scared. Although <br> found them lying on the floor. I hope to solve 2 questions in least amount of time or atleast solve 2 questions.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>20:09: </b></ins></i> Contest is for 3 hours.</p>
<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 16- 16th January, Monday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>8:54: </b></ins></i> Got up today on time at 5:40 or so. Just completed Luv playlist and moved to GFG course. Then rushed to Ramadu Sir's class at<br> around 9. For the first time in this semester sat on the first bench. It was good experience, although felt a little sleepy.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>11:20: </b></ins></i> Filled the inter IIT form. The PS is on web3 and crypto, one of the things which I don't understand at all. Updated the website.<br>I will do the icons part and TPC spreadsheet work afterwards.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>14:25: </b></ins></i> Just continued with the GFG course. Just had lunch in between. I need to go to environmental lab, probably my first lab. I am<br> thinking of having tea in between.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>17:10: </b></ins></i> Just came back from lab. Lab got over half an hour before, but stopped by E-Cell to pick up my hoodie and billa, it seems both were <br>not there as I was technically not part of E-Summit and had not paid for hoodie. Met Parth and Ashwath bhaiya there, talked up a bit then came back. The most <br>important thing on my mind now is to do TPC work, as bhaiya has already called to do it. After that I have a meet of Tehchnex Branding Team.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>19:30: </b></ins></i> Just came back from branding meet. Although it was not very productive overall, but a good way to interact. Saw Inter Hostel going <br>on. I want to be part of it but there are only limited no. of things that I can do in a day. Also it is not very rewarding.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>21:00: </b></ins></i> Just completed 350+ companies in TPC sheet. I will just have dinner and do some CP questions most probably. Remaining all the work <br> of Invest India and DPI or TPC will do tomorrow.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>23:25: </b></ins></i> Talked with MOM, had my dinner and got the news of this year's DAAD scholars from our college. Feeling very sleepy rn. See ya! </p>


<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 17- 17th January, Tuesday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>9:37: </b></ins></i> Got up today at 5:30 or so, probably half an hour after the alarm. Checked WA and then started with the GFG course. Felt a little <br>bored so started with some CP questions. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>12:30: </b></ins></i> Hungry, probably go for lunch. I probably have a class after half an hour or so.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>16:30: </b></ins></i> Just returned from 2 classes, although they were supposed to get over 1 hour before. After the class, went to see Prof. Mahendra <br> Pal to issue books from department library. Library was open but all the shelves were closed so basically it was of no use to us. Had to issue this soil <br> engineering book by Ranjan and Rao, both for explo and dept course. Unfortunately he was not available at that moment and asked us to come tomorrow post lunch. Other <br> thing was to discuss my overload of MA-202 course. Although I had filled on the portal but hadn't submitted any application regarding this. So I am skeptical that <br> I may have that course this semester and I may miss something. Things are still very unclear. I asked Rajesh Sir but, he was sometime saying yes other times <br> saying No. Also went to DOAA office to find and conclude the matter but RK Singh Sir was not there.</i></p>
<p><i><ins><b>17:00: </b></ins></i> Came back and did some questions, then had to go to ABLT-4 for dreaded test proctoring. Also ate some ladoos for the first time <br>they are more crunchy. Bad company, no timer on test no dashboard, nothing just a simple webpage. I have to even leave my tutorial class for it as delayed the <br>reponse to WA message.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>19:00: </b></ins></i> Came back and did some questions, then had to go to ABLT-4 for dreaded test proctoring. Also ate some ladoos for the first time <br>they are more crunchy. Bad company, no timer on test no dashboard, nothing just a simple webpage.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>00:00: </b></ins></i> Continued with the CP questions, but still I am not seeing the growth as expected, I don't know if it is that slow, but it is <br> surprisngly slow. I am trying to ramp it up by all means but doesn't seem to give in. Maybe I have to devote more myself to it because time is very limited and there <br>is always scope of optimisation in everything. </p>
<p>Also started with the CY 203 notes and slides so it doesn't piles up in the end and also missed this first important tutorial. </p>

<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 18- 18th January, Wedesday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>00:00: </b></ins></i>Sorry couldn't update this.</p>

<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 19- 19th January, Thrushday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>8:50: </b></ins></i>It's Brind's sir class so need to be on time. Feeling very grumpy but can't sleep, it would to wake up again.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>12:00: </b></ins></i> Just came back from lab and classes, struggled very hard to remain awake in first class, just falling down again and again.<br>Skipping a night's sleep is not advisable to anyone, anytime. In the lab Sir, scolded for copying and not even writing 1 original line. Warned for grade C, if the same attitude continues. My lab file was also not complete so lucky on that part.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>16:15: </b></ins></i>I had few hours before another lab and class. Took a long time in lunch just siiting and chatting. Came back, didn't had much time <br>before the next class so thought of getting proxy and slept for an hour. Then went to building planning lab. It is a complete waste of time, met Manish bhaiya there<br>, he had this course as an overload because, he forgot to register for this course on registration portal. Talked on general business and stuff. He recongnised me immediately.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>18:00: </b></ins></i> The intern session got over. All the seniors, who got an oncampus intern came and shared their experience. But had to cut this <br>session very short, as Mugdha didi is branding head herself and there was this Qawalli session at 19:00. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>22:30: </b></ins></i> Had my dinner after coming back from that Qawalli session. Really liked it. Initially was unwilling to go there but knew if I sat <br>then I will sleep and it will basically destroy my schedule so decided to go there.</p>

<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 20- 20th January, Friday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>9:50: </b></ins></i> Got up quite late as had not slept the previous night. Just woke up in between when Zeeshan called to put his luggage in my room.<br>, then slept again. Bathed brushed for around 1 hr, although the water was not so hot. He infact asked me if I can rest on his room, which pissed me for a moment <br> as it was too much for a stranger, I shoudln't have agreed in the first place.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>12:40: </b></ins></i> Had my lunch, now will start with my work now, a lot needs to be done. Just updated the website for last 2 days.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>13:30: </b></ins></i> Just wasted some time on yt while writing for website. Started with work after probably after half hour.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>14:02: </b></ins></i> Started with reading slides, getting an overview of the subject and what all things/ topics are there. It seems they are not very much inter-related. Initially it had some basic concepts which I am already aware of, then it moves to little complex processes of glycolysis. But it is very easy to <br>remember as it is very systematic and methodological. I think I spent twice the time that I needed to spend. I am doing CP now as got a little bored with it.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>18:02: </b></ins></i> Started with bit of but there is lot of noise outside because of this Darshan Raval show, everyone is chatting and getting ready.<br>I have this baggage of Zeeshan's which forbids me to go with them. Also I have to collect that left money from canteen and get a photocopy of my ID card. Suddenly,<br>it all rushed as Papa called to transfer some money and it created problems.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>19:15: </b></ins></i> Finally Zeeshan came and picked his bags and went. Got a badge from Arpit as he asked the senior for badges, I didn't knew it will <br>help that much. There was this insanely long line to enter so somehow entered in the region crossing the outer boundry, progressed further and entered the ADV <br>ground by showing the badge. Initially I gave up on going further due to packed density, but slowly gradually got ahead. Difficulty in moving from last to final <br>barricade was equivalent to moving from first barricade to near the stage. Crowd got more and more resilient as moved forward, but it was all finally worth it. I <br>got as close as possible, so close that I could touch him. Among many videos that I too,the 18 sec video became famous, everyone who saw the video asked for it.</p>
<p> On the way back, took some pictures. Some interesting things happened, Mohan and I betted that he will made a girl to talk to me. I accepted it, although shoudln't have done it. He asked one random girl that "He wants to talk to you" and it was matter of 1 sec that she looked at me and passed by. It was so embrassing for the moment, but it's ok it implied that I have low very self esteem.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>23:00: </b></ins></i> Came to hostel, but guessed the mess already closed, should have explored it as it was open. I was thinking of doing a CP question <br> but why fake it to make a streak.</p>


<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 21- 21st January, Saturday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>6:50: </b></ins></i> Just got up, alarm was of around 5:30 or so. Just sat down for studying after some time felt hungry as hadn't eaten anything from <br>night. Again came back and saw the WA message of Seema Mausi to talk, I was also thinking of doing this but this was perfect.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>10:30: </b></ins></i> Just came back from talking with Mausaji, it was 2 hour long call, really enjoyed it. Talked on variety of things including<br>
college, life and carrer. Just wrote down all these things.</p>
<ol>
    <li>RISK lena bahadur aadmi ki nishaani hoti he(JATT boy)</li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
</ol>
<p><i><ins><b>13:30: </b></ins></i> Then went to have lunch as I had to go to TPO for the interview duty. Although time was <br>12 sharp, but knew Ankit was already <br>there so didn't bothered to rush. I had my lunch, went there, very few candidates were remaining so didn't took much time. Came back.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>17:10: </b></ins></i>Started with CP, then it was time to go for Bassi show. Most of them had already left. Same thing happened as last day. Badge helped
<br> to move forward, got in there. Moved forward but security arrangements were very tight today so couldn't go close. It was short show probably 1 hour or so, he<br>performed 3 sets.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>19:40: </b></ins></i> Came back, after the show to give contest, irritated and frustrated as evryone had GFs, even those who look like or are shit.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>22:10: </b></ins></i> It got over. Stuck on first question for a long time, one test case was not passing. Tried very hard for second question, but
<br>couldn't converge on a particular solution. I was hungry so went to canteen to have something. Met Atharv on the way. While eating he even offered to pay the bills,<br>but it is not good if you yourself have money. Came back chatted with Mayank for a while then slept at around 23:00.</p>


<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 22- 22nd January, Sunday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>7:00: </b></ins></i> Alarm could not wake up. Woke up in 6 hours or so. Started with the question 1 of last day's contest to see different approaches.<br>. Spent around 40 mins, by chance Puneet was giving virtual contest. I was doing brute force. I should have optimised it. His solution was better. Moved to 2nd <br>, was very disappointed, did some very stupid silly mistakes in counting even after rechecking. Otherwise it was much shorter than 1st question. But, it's ok we learn.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>8:30: </b></ins></i>Had my breakfast, after solving a few questions</p>
<p><i><ins><b>12:30: </b></ins></i> Tony came insisted to go to Rajputana to see folk dance competition going on. I was unwilling to go but thought to go refresh my mind. Didn't enjoyed much so came back after a while, sun was shinning bright and high, while coming back also had my lunch.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>15:20: </b></ins></i> Fed up with CP, have to change the stream. Updated the website. Thinking of studying core for a bit.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>16:20: </b></ins></i>< Started reading transportation from Google classroom, it was big book so thought of havng a clarity on what to read and what not
<br>to, so asked Darshan. Spent some time in laughing and chatting.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>18:10: </b></ins></i>Read from slides, understood some basic concepts, then it was time to go to Raftaar show. Just got ready(I mean wore my shoes, <br> that's it LOL). So much crowd was already there, badges were also not working, waited on the sidelines of barricades to convince police to let me go. In the mean time <br>the barricades crashed and fell, leading to outburst of people. Somehow managed to enter safely. Due to the density there was no chance of going forward. So went <br>backstage to see Raftaar. Couldn't see him. I was requesting this other guy to let me enter, a big stupid, he had no clue what to do.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>22:00: </b></ins>Show got cancelled due to indecency. I was trying to be with Arin and Akshat tried talking but they absolutely ignored me. Felt very bad <br> and insignificant. On the way back, Ankur was teasing of not giving votes if I stand in Parliament election. Manish was joking about my badge thing that it didn't worked, but I think <br>I am totally responsible for all of this, as I only told this to others. Had a little tiffle with Ojas.</p>

    
<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 25- 25nd January, Wednesday</i></h3>  
<p><i><ins><b>6:00: </b></ins></i> Sorry haven't upadated the website from past 2 days. Just had been a little busy. Woke up around 5:15 or so, that is on time. I was <br>not feeling good mentally. Brushed and sat for a little reconsideration, as I messed in last day's contest. Could only solve one. Although I have been practicing <br>a lot these days, but still no improvement. Was quite frustrated with that. I expected improvement, at least not on time but problem solving atleast. But it seems <br>far off from where I imagined to be. I need to do things differently elsewise it is downhill already. Either I need to accept it or move away from it. There is also<br> a contest today, thinking of giving it. On comparing with other people's progress, it is nothing.</p>
<p>I am thinking of making that design thing, it is this unecessary burden on me, as I almost know they will go with that first one but still I have to do it.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>7:15: </b></ins></i> Wasted half an hour on YT reels, it happened after a long time though. Was absolutely not in working mood. Just saw some designs, ideated on it a little bit, then went on to have breakfast.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>7:40: </b></ins></i>Came back from breakfast, thinking of going to class a little early. Will probably write assignment or lab report.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>12:15: </b></ins></i> Came back from all the classes, right from 8 in the morning. Anish texted yesterday for meetup, but read it quite late. So asked <br>for meetup at 12, but no reply. Will probably have lunch then. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>12:40: </b></ins></i>Had lunch came back, then worked on design for some time, it will be time to go to lab class. Design is so time consumning tbh</p>
<p><i><ins><b>18:15: </b></ins></i>Just came back from lab then there was gap of half an hour between CY 103 class, so had ice-cream in between. Then went to class <br>but no one was there to teach. Everyone was roaming around mindlessly. I came back to class luckily, as sir came and someone was climbing tree and he scolded them <br>, so technically 1 hour was wasted due to all this crap.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>19:40: </b></ins></i>Fininshed the design shit, and then it was almost contest time so instead of having dinner, started with the contest. It took lot of time to solve first question although it was too easy, I read the question wrong. But then suddenly it was made unrated, so had my dinner after that. Tried solving <br>2nd after that.</p>



<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 26- 26th January, Thrushday</i></h3> 
<p><b>HAPPY REPUBLIC'S DAY</b></p>
<p><i><ins><b>7:30: </b></ins></i> Woke up quite late after alarm, but anyways it is a holiday today. Days are passing by very fast and I don't think I am progressing <br>at the optimum rate</p>
<p>didn't feel like updating today, will try to be more regular from tomorrow</p>


<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 27- 27th January, Friday</i></h3> 
<p><i><ins><b>7:50: </b></ins></i>woke up quite late as slept late. Anyways, class is from 9. Got up brushed, had my breakfast. Came back to go to class, went early <br> but was unfortunate enough to forget my mobile so no use of coming early, had no idea what teacher is teaching. TIME WASTED</p>
<p><i><ins><b>10:10: </b></ins></i> Came back, didn't want to attend the biochem class as already time wasted. So came back went to the bathroom and started writing <br>the assignment. Was not focussed that much, also opened YT in between but only for relevant things or so. Yesterday was also not productive, although it should <br>have been as no classes. I need to look into this also. As weekends should be most busy days as there is no routine, but it is going exactly opposite, need TO <br> RAISE THE BAR BOI.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>14:03: </b></ins></i> Continued with the assingment, had lunch in between. Wasted a bit of time on exploring the different wallpapers of<br><b>PRESDIENT PUTIN</b> couldn't find single high res image. IT started while reading some news report on RUSSIA-UKRAINE war.</p>

<img src="https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2023/01/25/thumbs_b_c_9f09dea7e1c500ef4ba8dfbca4ca5a7d.jpg?v=201922" width=100% height=auto>


<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 28- 28th January, Saturday</i></h3> 
    <p>Sorry, quite busy with this inter IIT thing, happened so fast. Ayushi was selected initially but she was not on campus and I also called Manish bhaiya regarding <br>this. </p>
<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 29- 29th January, Sunday</i></h3> 
<p><i><ins><b>12:03: </b></ins></i> Got up at 9:20 or so today, was planning to get a little earlier but to get up I need to be subconciously prepared to do that, but <br>anyways. Had my breakfast. Bathed, it was much needed tbh. I had taken this notebook from Abhijeet for class notes so clicked relevant photos of Soil and Traffic <br>courses.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>12:03: </b></ins></i> Just opened the laptop to start my work and got to know that there is no light at all in the hostel. Phone also had quite low <br> battery, so I am thinking of going to library. It makes life so difficult when light is not there, it seems it is more important than food.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>14:03: </b></ins></i> Came to library also, but no light here. But luckily light has come and I am going back to my hostel.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>19:03: </b></ins></i> Came back to hostel, had to continue with this Inter IIT PS as no progress had been made till now on it due to light issues and we <br>were also working late on it. We buckled up made the summaries of all the ideas that we had thought out. But initially it was ok but after doing some work, it <br> became very very slow and I was feeling a bit overloaded with same kind of stuff.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>21:40: </b></ins></i> Just came back to the room after some rest. Although I got there at last, everyone was already there and discussing stuff for how much time. I had my dinner, rested my back and then just saw some CP questions, just saw it, not in a mental state to solve them. My whole sleep cycle is upside down. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>23:50: </b></ins></i>SUBMITTED THE FIRST TASK OF INTER IIT PS. Big deal tbh. But review from seniors is so so so critical, never realised that. They gave
<br> very critical and constructive views, gave us a totally different viewpoint on how to look at things, what someone is doing and why not. There were lot of
<br>questions, that was left unanswered or we need to think them through. Quite impressive how MANISH bhaiya cross-questioning and it's always not about tech. He gave <br>industry examples on what all and how extensively things are going which we might not be aware of or will this work, how will you get the parameters, will they be <br> relevant and how impactful they will be. On the incentive thing, he asked simple questions on Google incentives, are they personalised or not and privacy laws and why Google, facebook is not using Bayesian Networks.</p>
    
    
    
 
 <h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 30- 30th January, Monday</i></h3>
 <p><i><ins><b>00:23: </b></ins></i> I shouldn't be writing at this point of time, but what to do. I have to deal with all this- CORE, SDE, BIZ, CLASSES. It is making
 <br>my life tough, but I hope output/ final result is good. AS SOON AS I CAME BACK, people started asking me for assignment. UFF!! was completely disconnected with <br>shit, now have to do this also.</p>
 <p><i><ins><b>8:53: </b></ins></i> Got up at right 15 mins before class at 9, although set an alarm of 5 hours or so but couldn't wake up at that time. I am not in the beast mode, I think. Like had this been exam day I have leapt even before time.</p>
 <p><i><ins><b>11:03: </b></ins></i> Came back from class, gave clothes to dhobi, put my blanket in the drawer as it was not needed, washed my face, filled water bottles and updated the website. Now I will probably do that interview transcription part and then complete my lab report.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>13:03: </b></ins></i> Started with interview transciption then, got a little bored because it was getting a bit slow. Had my lunch, got to know that <br>
 had CY103 class at 13:30 so rushed back, completed my lab file. Went to CY 103 class but suddenly remembered about connecting with Anish. He had texted me before <br> in the morning but I was too busy with my life. Thankfully texted him back and asked for a different time, and he had also asked for follow up. Fixed it at 17:00</p>
<p><i><ins><b>18:03: </b></ins></i> Got late in CY 103 class, so he didn't gave attendance. Then rushed to environmental LAB. Such a waste of time it is tbh. Also it
    <br>took 30 mins more. I came few minutes earlier, should have played that TPC trick much earlier. </p>
    <p>I have to do the following tasks ASAP</p>
    <ol>
 <li> DO CP</li>
 <li> Complete that interview transcription</li>
 <li> Do assignment of environment and structural </li>
 <li>Intern work of hosting on web</li>
 <li>Analytics report making</li>
 <li> Inter IIT PS review</li>
 <li>Complelte lab file for transport and geotech</li>
        </ol>
  <p><i><ins><b>23:10: </b></ins></i> Tried one 1000 rating question couldn't solve it, then gave a virtual contest Div 3 held recently. Solved 3 of them. Felt very <br>relaxed. Now I should complete this environment assignment. <a href="file:///D:/Scores.pdf">>Inter IIT scores came for round 1</a>, we are 9 in
      <br>the list</p>  
 <p><i><ins><b>23:45: </b></ins></i> Just going in 529 for a short meet. Maybe we would discuss our future plan of action</p> 



<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 31- 31st January, Tuesday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>01:10 </b></ins></i> Although I shouldn't be writing at this point of time but again life is going through tough times. Nothing serious was discussed in <br>the meet, nothing relevant tbh. I don't know why I am so slow to react to my needs, like I knew there is option to go back to room, but I was just delaying it.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>03:45: </b></ins></i> Just completed the Environmental assignment, and started with little bit of Structural one, but's it's time to sleep now.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>7:50: </b></ins></i> Got up, brushed and had my breakfast. I am thinking of completing the Invest India task as of now.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>11:50: </b></ins></i> Started at 8:30, got completed with the task assigned. Initially struggled with technical stuff but figured out after spending some <br>time. Although became anxious for some time, because I solved it when I left it and now same problem is arising. Took a lot of time.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>15:40: </b></ins></i> Connected with Anish to tell him the work is done. He replied and got in touch after lunch. Then went to class as I was writing
<br>structural assignment. Prof accidentally called out my roll no. and asked me to tell what is "water content". I had a little idea what he was talking about, so just quite and he asked me to come of my seat and again asked the same question. I couldn't answer. I didn't knew it would backfire so hard. People were litreally <br> laughing at me, which are like half of my caliber. It is feeling so so bad, I can't tell it in words. This is the worst moment till now. I pledge to teach everyone a <br>lesson. It is for me and me no one else. I will remember it every second of my life. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>18:40: </b></ins></i> Came back from biochem tut. Probably do CP. Although feeling quite sleepy.</p>    
   <p><i><ins><b>21:20: </b></ins></i> Finished with the contest time to have dinner and then go for inter IIT discussions.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>23:59: </b></ins></i> Just came back from, will proabaly have to wrap up task given by Mugdha didi.</p>



<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 32- 1st Febuary, Wednesday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>00:40: </b></ins></i> Time to sleep, can't sustain more. I know I shouldn't be writing at this point of time, but life is wrecked right now. I wish <br> all would be over before my patience tank runs out dry.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>6:30: </b></ins></i> Was supposed to get up at 5:30 but I don't know I was fighting with some problem, was quite restless at that time. But anyways <br> barely completed the assignment of CE 231. Rushed to have breakfast and then went to class.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>13:05: </b></ins></i> Just came back from 4 classes. Last class stretched half an hour more. But anyways I am feeling quite grudgy, so will have a nap.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>13:05: </b></ins></i> Didn't slept much just lied down for 1 hour, then opened laptop checked messages on teams@Invest India. Was asked to share <br> conclusions and key insights of Union budget, but not possible at this point of time as there is lab.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>16:35: </b></ins></i> Came back from the lab, did nothing much just toggling. There is another tutorial of biochem at 17:30.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>18:15: </b></ins></i> Just came back from tut, it got over early. Now I will probably do CP till 8:30 or so.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>20:40: </b></ins></i> Just going for dinner, it's already late. Hope to have some progress over PS.</p>




<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 33- 2nd Febuary, Thrushday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>00:15: </b></ins></i> Just came back from there, interacted witH Manav bhaiya in between and Suyash bhaoya also came to guide us. We divided the work <br>, I along with Shetty are bascially working on tech side. How to handle the real world complexity, how it actually works.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>6:36: </b></ins></i> Got up, immediately started with the Invest India work of finding ASUs as it was pending and might not get completed.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>8:50: </b></ins></i>Got over with the work, now have to rush to class. Basically submitted the spreadsheet and 1 pager reference on how the research<br>was done.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>11:40: </b></ins></i>Just came back from a class and lab. I am not feeling good, will probably have to take a nap.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>13:05: </b></ins></i>Had a nap, had my lunch now will do some CP questions till another lab of building planning.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>18:15: </b></ins></i>Came back from library, after having a discussion with Inter IIT team, went directly from lab to library. Will continue with CP.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>20:40: </b></ins></i> Will have my dinner and will probably go for discussion for Inter IIT</p>




<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 34- 3nd Febuary, Friday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>01:00: </b></ins></i> Just came back from 529. It was very intense discussion. I am very tired now, will hit the bed now. Roomies are playing music, I don't know how to tell them. I asked here and there for a place to sleep then went to Mohan's room as there is combined bed.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>8:50: </b></ins></i> Had my breakfast, studied transportation, highway part. Got up at 6:30 or so came back to my room and started with bit of<br> transportation engineering. Then went to Ramadu's class and to my surprise he has already taken attendance as I was 1 minute late. But anyways he conducted attendance <br>. Then went to CY-103 class but prof didn't came, we waited for 30 mins or so.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>10:40: </b></ins></i> Came back and googled some of IOI medallists and if I can clear google without CP. Then came back to Transporation. After some time <br>Vedang Asagonkar name came to my mind and started searching him for a bit.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>13:10: </b></ins></i> Started with a bit of CP. Didn't go to class at 14:30, rather skipped it and continued with CP, till 17:00 or so then went to<br>library for Inter IIT meet.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>18:10: </b></ins></i> Was absolutely not feeling well so decided to do low value work like transcribing the interview. It was absolutely not productive
<br>time period. I had to sleep at around 20:00.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>21:10: </b></ins></i> Got up, talked with mom, had my dinner and went to the disucussion for inter IIT.</p>



<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 35- 4th Febuary, Saturday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>01:10: </b></ins></i> The discussion got over, it was productive and now we would start with the report making and model making from morning. I would be <br>working with report making. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>02:30: </b></ins></i> Went to canteen for eating something with Suyash bhaiya in Vishvesharaya. Talked and had some lighter moments. Felt good, although
<br>I could have slept at that time but it is always nice for bonding and future relations. We expect to win gold in this event.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>8:30: </b></ins></i> Got up, blowed my nose, had breakfast and updated the website.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>10:00: </b></ins></i> Though it is time to go to library but no one has been so punctual. So can start with little bit of core, just seeing the syllabus.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>13:10: </b></ins></i> Went there, nothing much was accomplished. I was absolutely not feeling well, but I did that ASUs work. Came back for lunch, met <br>Harsh playing chess. Didn't knew he also extensively did CP. Just had a quick side chat with him on what should I do and what not. Went to HG to purchase some <br>medicines.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>14:30: </b></ins></i>Went back did some ideation on the structure of report by taking a walk with Suyash. Had our model reviewed by Vaibhav bhaiya.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>18:10: </b></ins></i> Library was about to close, so packed up and it was decided to meet at 21:30 sharp. Stopped at LC to have some tea.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>23:00: </b></ins></i> Slept for 3 hours or so, with intervention from calls and alarms. Went to Vishveraya canteen to have something, now I am ready for <br> a study session.</p>


<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 36- 5th Febuary, Sunday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>3:30: </b></ins></i>Studied till 3:30 or so. Productivity could have definitely been increased though.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>10:35: </b></ins></i> Woke up, had my brakfast, bathed. Feeling good and lighter and better. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>13:10: </b></ins></i> Did this report making thing for inter IIT as I had not done anything in night. Then studied for a bit after having my lunch.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>14:30: </b></ins></i> Came to 529 to do more on it. Searched some IIM A profs to connect further and review more. One reply came from IIM A prof and it <br> was quite positive as it was validating use of Bayesian network if we have intermediate nodes that affect decision making.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>17:16: </b></ins></i> I am getting bored here in 529 tbh. I want to leave and do complete the soil chapter and do some coding questions.</p>



<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 38- 7th Febuary, Tuesday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>7:20: </b></ins></i> I have been sleeping a lot lately. I had an alarm for 2 hours before but was quite lazy, also as I think of sleeping my cough <br> starts. It disturbs the flow. I need to sleep less and work more. There is lot to do. Got up, had my breakfast and sat down at my laptop.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>10:40: </b></ins></i> Just completed the figma portion of the knowledge model that we built. Most of the peeps liked it. I was thinking of calling the <br>Prof. immediately then DM of Abhirvey came to get the chart. I gave him the chart and called both of the Prof's there. Luckily, Prof Anuj Kapoor himself picked up <br>the call, it was a WOW moment. I told him about the PS and what we are doing and requested for a call, but as expected he was fully packed, but he did send 2 PDFs <br> to add to our PS. He was very polite and humble, felt nice after talking. Tried other prof also, but he is on leave. Sat there for a few minutes and came back to <br>the room.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>13:10: </b></ins></i> Just had my lunch and planning to going to class now.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>16:10: </b></ins></i> Just came back from classes. Updated the website and did some TPC calls, most were non productive. Continued with CP and the class <br>got cancelled.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>19:10: </b></ins></i> Wi-fi of the whole area got cut. Initially for the Inter IIT thing, working using hotsopt, but then it was also not working. It was <br>such a nightmare. It felt very difficult to live without wi-fi. Started with the notes making of soil as nothing else to do.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>11:10: </b></ins></i> After some Abhirvey called to work agsin. Went there did a bit of figma work. Was absolutely feeling unwell that night.</p>



<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 39- 8th Febuary, Wednesday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>01:30: </b></ins></i> Just came back from the Inter IIT room then went to canteen. Have a big assignment in front of me and remaining night. Obviously cannot sleep today <br>but I hope I am able to complete it today.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>6:35: </b></ins></i> Just completed the assignment. Gave it to Dhruv as I won't be able to attend the class. Will probably sleep for hour or two.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>9:35: </b></ins></i> Got up, missed two classes but still 2 classes are remaining. Went to both the classes.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>12:40: </b></ins></i>Came back, had my lunch. I am dead tired. Just lied down <br> on the bed, didn't slept much though. Now I have Geo-tech lab.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>11:50: </b></ins></i> On the way back from CY-103 tutorial, saw Manav and others standing, stopped there. They were taking feedback. The feedback was good <br>. Came back called home. MOM suggested to have tablets and honey for sore thorat. Bought those, had my dinner. It all took 2 hours or so. I won't be able to do <br>CP today. Went to the inter IIT room as tomorrow is the deadline.Initially no one came so I was just seeing the CF extension. Then did a little bit of figma<br>work.</p>




<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 40- 9th Febuary, Thrushday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>02:00: </b></ins></i> As we were doing work, Aneesh bhaiya was planning to come. After that nothing was substaintial was done. He understood the model <br> first. Not much feedback on it though. Then bitching of Mech profs started. I did my last part of figma work then came back to room.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>9:01: </b></ins></i> Alarm was for 8 actually, got up at exactly 9. Without wasting a min rushed to the class as Prof. Brind is very strict for time.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>11:50: </b></ins></i> Came back from lab, it is still time for the mess. Just resting a bit on bed. Then had my lunch. Started looking for the AutoCAD <br>drawing as today is the submission deadline. Found a few but will do it most probably in the night. Thinking of doing CP, but have a class now.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>13:30: </b></ins></i> Nothing much accomplished in the gap. Will just go to the Environment class and then to lab.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>17:00: </b></ins></i> Just returned from library. Went there just after lab. Talked with Ratnakar Pandey Sir UX head at Amazon. Talked with him very <br>confidently, with all the jargons used. He said he was very happy and even told his wife what these folks are doing and how relevant it is. Suggested few points <br>which we can add or modify. Also met Nitesh bhaiya in the library. He suggested to focus on DSA and if not able to understand then do CP. It was very productive to <br>go to library on the contrary of what I was thinking before to go to the room and do CP.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>18:30: </b></ins></i> Came back from the library and settled a bit, had a lovely video call with FAMILY- mom, dad, sis. Felt really nice. Now will solve <br>a question or two of CP then focus everything on report submission.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>18:30: </b></ins></i> Watched the "Flatheads" shark tank video. As soon as I finished it Abhirvey called to come to 529. Obviously I had to go as it is <br> the submisson night.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>18:30: </b></ins></i> I have been sitting here from 7 and have done nothing else. I am thinking I wasted a lot of time here as I am not contributing much
<br> I have just bascially just read one report by IIMA prof. That is why probably I don't like business competitions. Now I am feeing all of this. But actually this <br>many people are not required for all of this. Anyways once this is over, I have to damn focus on branch study and then DSA.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>23:50: </b></ins></i>Submitted the report on time. It is looking very very good and it has the highest weightage. I left as it would be waste of time, if I stay as work is done.</p>


<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 41- 10th Febuary, Friday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>7:00: </b></ins></i> Got up at 7 or so alarm was for 5:30. I don't know what has happened to me but alarms are not working for me, though they used to <br>work very well. I need to look into it. I will probably have my breakfast now then go to class. Maybe to save 1 hour in sleeping, I waste more time in it.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>11:10: </b></ins></i> Just came back from classes of Geotech and Biochem. I was the first one to go and open the classroom LOL!!. Just sat there opened <br>my books. Sir, came on time. He started with the slides and stuff. For the first time, I tried to listen to sir and it was ok but whatever he taught, could be read <br> in few minutes. After that rushed to CY-103 class. New prof, Rajnish Sir was there, teaching basic stuff. But he was very progressive like during the class, he <br>asked questions and in the end asked what we are looking into as a carrer prospect. He suggested to have the tutorials in a more innovative way like coding and <br>stuff in Jupyter Notebooks, felt really really nice.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>17:00: </b></ins></i> After coming back started with the CP, solved 2 questions then stuck on 3rd, had my lunch. Tried again couldn't do it. Took my <br> laptop in the class as explo period was also there. Solved that problem in the class. After the class we had to meet Supriya Mam. We had little bit to show to mam. The <br>discussion went well, but in the end we committed a huge amount of work and midsems are also approaching. But we will figure out I guess.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>17:30: </b></ins></i> Continued with CP further.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>18:57: </b></ins></i> Abhirvey called for Inter IIT task. Went to the 726 room directly. Everyone was already there doing work. Today FMC weekend also <br>started and "Jab We Met" is being streamed. But can't see as our deck is not ready yet.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>21:30: </b></ins></i> Came back from dinner. I think I have to spend my whole night here.</p>



<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 42- 11th Febuary, Satuday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>21:30: </b></ins></i> As usual sleep schedule is destroyed.</p>

<p>I am back after the Inter IIT saga. We devoted 2 weeks straight in it. I was litreally destroyed after it. It not only affected physically but also took an <br>emotional and psycological toll. We gave in everything for it. But I guess all the bad things are over now, after the scrutiny meet of seniors last night. They <br> called us for the hoody, but it was a general meetup for people for different PS. It made one more thing clear that we were one of the hardest working team in the <br> contingent. Some teams litreally had the courage to say, they didn't gave their hundred percent. It noew feels more bad. GrowSimple won Gold, saw Lakshya Singh <br> and SD, they had different vibes, need to be like them. I was pissed off the day result was announced. I litreally put up the status "#Depression Incoming, Stay <br>away from me for 2-3 days." Now it may seem stupid but it seemed very normal at that time. I didn't sleep that night at all. Switched off my phone.</p>
<br>
<p> But I need to take this a learning oppurtunity to gain back the lethalness and sharpness back and to comeback very very hard.</p>



<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 47- 16th Febuary, Thrushday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>7:30: </b></ins></i> Got up at 7:30 sharp, right on time. Also asked mom to wake me up at that time. Had my breakfast. Sat back to study Highway(Transport).<br> It was good learning study session overall. Had a lab at 10, missed the class at 9.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>11:30: </b></ins></i> Came back from the lab, it got over in half the time. Will study Traffic(Transport) now.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>12:40: </b></ins></i> Time to have lunch now. Tired a bit, will take a nap for a while after lunch.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>14:15: </b></ins></i> Just had a nap after lunch. Felt nice. Now have a lab of building planning. Missed Env. class.</p>


<p> Writing after long time as exams were going on and I was not feeling well.</p>
<br>
<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 56- 25th Febuary, Saturday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>6:50: </b></ins></i> Got up at 5 today, slept at 10 or so. I had already planned to bath right after waking up. So bathed, trimmed nails, brushed <br> teeth. Came back just sat down for a few moments, then thought of starting out after having my breakfast. Just wasted some time on phone, went to have breakfast.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>8:30: </b></ins></i> Came back was just reading some editorials from a website from Petr, then explored a little bit about DSA, what and where to <br>read. Got some clarity. But while in mess discussed with Kalpik about going to Sarnath, just casually. Somehow all things got arranged and finally we were set to <br>go. QUITE unexpected huh!!.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>15:15: </b></ins></i> Came back from there with a tons of memories, fun and enjoyment. Although it was nothing w.r.t to hype that has been created but <br>we enjoyed. Most fun part was bike riding, I loved it. Although it was very difficult to drive in the extremely busy streets of Banaras. Saw some foreigners, <br> Tibetan monks, but didn't got any vibe of any meditation or Bodhic philosphy. It was completely missing. Just came back on time to had lunch.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>16:00: </b></ins></i>Slept for 90 mins or so as very tired from roaming around.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>17:45: </b></ins></i> It was not sound sleep at all. Now I will work heads down on DSA. Let's see how it goes.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>18:55: </b></ins></i> Started a little bit with the lectures, feeling a bit weird in the head. I am just writing what he is explaining.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>19:45: </b></ins></i> Abhigyan bhaiya is giving party today, I guess for the PPO. I probably have to go to the TPC party now.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>23:45: </b></ins></i> Just came back, it was fun listening to all the gossips and internal matter of the TPC. Some things were very surprising for me. <br> Quite unexpected seeing the scope of things that are at operation in the cell. Talked a lot on various aspects. But a lot of time is also gone, so probably <br> will have to sit quite hard tomorrow.</p>



<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 57- 26th Febuary, Sunday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>6:40: </b></ins></i> Woke up, brushed my teeth, had my breakfast. Met Dheeraj there, talked about the intern season. Regarding the ongoing progress of <br>his friends. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>9:30: </b></ins></i> Came back from the breakfast, talked with Mom Dad. Roamed around for a bit and just updated the website. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>10:30: </b></ins></i> Posted my intern certificate on Linkedin, took some time to write the content though. I was bit confused whether should I do it <br>or not. I am not sure of the response that I might get. from it.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>12:15: </b></ins></i> Started with the lectures. Quite distracted initially but stable afterwards. Now feeling a bit hungry, time to have lunch.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>13:30: </b></ins></i> I am wasting a lot of time in useless discussions with peers that are absolutely not relevant to me in any sense. I need to cut <br>down on this as every minute is crucial now.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>15:00: </b></ins></i> I am feeling a bit tired, need to rest a bit. I am not getting that flow. It is very disturbing honestly to work this way, and I <br> don't know why I this is happening but it is so ridiculous. I know my condition and I know the stats but still it is happening.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>16:50: </b></ins></i> Woke up, might work late in the night. Will probably go to the canteen now. I am wasting so much time, I was so time consious but <br>, although I feel things more strongly now and have got a bit smarter now, but still it is lot of time I am wasting w.r.t to things I am thinking to achieve. I
<br>plan things but don't do it always. I need to be in the busiest phase of life trying very hard to get things, but it is exactly the opposite and after it is <br> over, there is nothing left except regret. Thinking to improve things in the future but the same loop continues.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>17:30: </b></ins></i> Just came back from canteen after wasting a lot of time. I have two primary tasks to do, first is to write mail content and then do <br>the intern's task.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>20:30: </b></ins></i> I am almost done with the content thing, now I have to move on to the RMD work. I am again and again being distracted to watch a <br>movie.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>22:30: </b></ins></i> Priynash came to see, wanted me to meet Ajay Vasisth for Parliament elections. It was waste of time tbh. He is one very delusional <br>fellow with his supporters brainwashing him. Got lucky to get an intern by cheating and then a PPO from Tata Projects. He thinks he has power but he doesn't.</p>




<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 58- 27th Febuary, Monday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>01:15: </b></ins></i> Came back after wasting time on the most useless thing in the world, discussion on politics.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>7:15: </b></ins></i> Got up, had my breakfast and updated the website.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>8:40: </b></ins></i> Didn't study much, just started out. Time to go to class. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>10:40: </b></ins></i> Came back, getting back to study. Stopped by to have tea and samosas.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>12:45: </b></ins></i> I was not very focussed watching "Godfather" in between, but it is over now. I need to work on these things as time is scarce. Will <br>probably have my lunch now and then go to class.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>14:50: </b></ins></i> Stopped by to have chocolate and chilled milk. Feeling very sleepy, need to take a nap now.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>15:30: </b></ins></i> Got up, not very deep sleep. But atleast I feel fresh now.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>16:50: </b></ins></i> It was a good session, I think. I also might have to go to Biz's all team meet. I don't want to go but senior's apporval is <br> necessary, might finally get an advice from Vaibhav bhaiya regarding intern season.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>19:10: </b></ins></i> Just came back from the meet, it was more or less a time waste. It started half an hour late and was not much productive.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>20:30: </b></ins></i> Just had my dinner, will continue till the time it is sustainable.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>23:10: </b></ins></i> Feeling sleepy now, should have slpet a bit earlier maybe.</p>


<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 59- 28th Febuary, Tuesday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>06:30: </b></ins></i> Got up. Sat at my laptop without brushing. It was not proudctive. Started with the "russia ukraine" news, then WA. Then also <br>passed 15 mins on YT reels.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>10:10: </b></ins></i>Went to have breakfast as have to go to class. He had already taken attendance in previous classes, which I was unaware of.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>12:50: </b></ins></i> Came back continued with DSA. Went to have lunch. Have a couple of classes in the afternoon.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>16:10: </b></ins></i> Had 2 classes. Prof spotted while talking, asked to meet after class. It was not serious though. Continued with DSA after deciding <br>to not go to CY 103 tutorial. It was not productive at all. I was not able to understand anything. Closed it, explored other options which were available in the <br>mega drive. I also have a pending assignment to do, so decided to finish that.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>20:30: </b></ins></i>It was long so went to have dinner in between. Then structural assign. also there, so did few questions from it also.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>23:30: </b></ins></i> Finally completed it with all the highlighting and stapling. There is some noise outside, proably due to Indresh's birthday. I <br> also moved out to see, as bored after writing the assignment.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>23:10: </b></ins></i></p>



<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 60- 1st March, Wednesday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>00:10: </b></ins></i> First GPL and cake cutting simultaneously LoL. Then people were dancing so watching them an hour passed.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>1:30: </b></ins></i> After coming back, in no mood to study, so started movie "Godfather". Slept after watching for an hour or so.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>3:10: </b></ins></i> Time to sleep.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>7:50: </b></ins></i> Had slept quite late. Had to submit the assignment for transportation engineering. Rushed to have my breakfast. I was thinking it <br> was Brind Sir's class but it was Structural's class.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>12:40: </b></ins></i> Came back from the class,  as usual he let us go quite late. Rested a bit. Went to have my lunch. After it met Shlok, talked for <br>some time. Feeling sleepy so lied down as there was class after 40 minutes.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>14:45: </b></ins></i> Woke up on time, but was bit lazy. Had tea in between, then went to the lab. I was expecting to enter without getting noticed but he was standing right in front, there was no way I could have noticed it due to his short height. He initially asked me to go back, but I didn't reacted anything so he <br>asked me the reason of coming late. I simply told him I was sleeping, he appreciated the honesty but said to give half attendance.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>17:10: </b></ins></i> From the lab went straight to see CY-103 answer sheet. Initially didn't had any idea where to go. Finally got to see my answer <br> sheet. I calculated my marks, it was nore than 20, I doubted it, so I again counted it was 21. I was obviously happy. It felt like good old days of my school where I <br>used to get first in all subjects, thanks to hardwork of my Mom. I really felt nice after a long time.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>17:35: </b></ins></i> On the way back had 2 Maaza. Discussed the marks for some time, then went to take a bath.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>23:10: </b></ins></i> Came back, passed some time on phone. Then sat at the laptop. I have one thing on my mind- to do that report task. I could have <br> done it yesterday, but was not in a mood and was stupid so didn't do it.</p>





<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 61- 2nd March, Thrushday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>00:10: </b></ins></i> After thinking a bit on how to do went to canteen to have tea. Now I am ready to implement it. I  might be a long night.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>2:40: </b></ins></i> I am almost done with it. I have donned to do some automation. I should have tried it harder earlier, it would have saved a lot of <br>time for earlier SQL work that I did manually. PYTHON is so powerful and useful, and I felt it. I was good that it didn't cause that much errors. Initially I was <br>manually doing for every excel sheet. It would have been inefficient and taken a lot of time.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>3:10: </b></ins></i> Just passing some time, to take a break. I need to now use it in R to include it in report. I am clueless about it.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>5:10: </b></ins></i> I am feeling very overwhelmed after completing the task. Need a proper break. I should sleep now.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>8:30: </b></ins></i> Got up, I don't by alarm or Bhargav came. Had my breakfast. Came back, I was not in a mood to go to class, as I wouldn't have been <br>able to sleep and it would have destroyed my day. I lied down again , forgot to put an alarm.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>11:50: </b></ins></i> WOW!! what a surprise, missed the lab.</p>


<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 62- 3rd March, Friday</i></h3>
<p>Did nothing all day, except watched a movie "Jaws" by Christopher Nolan. Other than that just sleeping, roaming around here and there. Preparing my bags to leave on <br>time. Eat Rumballs, felt nice.</p>




<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 63- 4th March, Saturday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>00:20: </b></ins></i> I am feeling very sleepy, but it is a long way to go, as train might get delayed. Need to keep moving or eating something. It is <br> just a test of patience. I am little annoyed how most of the people who came after are able to sleep or lie down and I am sitting and sleeping like a fool.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>2:15: </b></ins></i> Just few more moments, train is 1 hour delayed. Then I can sleep comfortably.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>3:15: </b></ins></i> Train arrived, I heard the announcement then rushed outside, after confirming if it is the right I settled the things, someone <br>else was sleeping on seat, he asked me to sleep on his seat, which I was absolutely okay with as I just wanted to sleep.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>15:00: </b></ins></i>Woke up. It is still a lot of time.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>18:00: </b></ins></i> Delhi has arrived, need to eat something. The food is so useless, costly and bogus here. Didn't expect it though. He gave me above
<br> MRP, got 10/- back though after confronting.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>22:42: </b></ins></i> Finally reached after 6 hours delay.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>23:30: </b></ins></i> Had my food, although I am not feeling sleepy but still had to sleep as both parents will sleep.</p>





<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 64- 5th March, Sunday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>7:30: </b></ins></i> Got up at around 7, came to my place and had tea. Settled in my place. Took out my laptop and notebooks. Haven't thought much <br> about what to do.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>18:15: </b></ins></i> Just woke up from nap. Had a bath now. Had my dinner.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>20:00: </b></ins></i> Again sat down at laptop, but now with some objectives to fulfill. Do something in the intern's work alloted to me. Update website. Draft some emails to IIMA professors to be sent tomorrow that is Monday or after Holi break. See my JEE Advanced responses, all my good, bad memories of JEE are <br>back. Whenever I think of it, it fills me with so much remorse, pain and regret that it is unbearable. Everything from Kota to FIITJEE to JEE drop flashbacks again <br> and again just telling me loudly, you missed a great chance.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>20:50: </b></ins></i> I am doing nothing even after seeing my JEE papers and analysis. JEE was so diversive, it was difficult to diagnose what the actual <br>problem was. It is more related to strategy and what to study then aptitude.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>9:50: </b></ins></i> Time to sleep, things will improve from tomorrow. I mean they have to.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>7:50: </b></ins></i></p>



<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 65- 6th March, Monday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>7:00: </b></ins></i> Got up. Had tea. Read newspaper.</p>



<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 68- 9th March, Thrushday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>19:38: </b></ins></i> At home as already aware. Desperately trying to get an research intern at IIMA. Updated my resume. Got it reviewed. Initially I was <br> doing and attending classes but I knew that once I went back to college, I would have no time to do this IIMA thing, so now is the best chance and it is worth it <br>dude. I have seen smart people doing it. I want to work with them. Enjoyed one day with Dadi ate Malpudas, saw my farms. Felt like a backup LoL. I saw lot of <br> lectures of Arrays. Now as I am writing this I break the loop of lectures and making a background for solving questions, after all it is the ultimate thing.</p>

<p> Updating the website everyday with time frames is difficult as there is lot of free time. I feel so so so sorry for myself that I was brainwashed by seniors in fest and design- bascially low value work. Although they did helped to some extent but for the misery I am to be blamed because I was so desperate for validation.
<br>I will get that research intern because I have to due to "Sunken Cost Fallacy" I have spent so much time on it, I need to make it productive.</p>



<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 73- 14th March, Tuesday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>11:30: </b></ins></i> Arrived at DDU. 30 mins late.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>13:08: </b></ins></i> Came in the campus. Sun is quite bright and it feels like summers here. To be honest I am nostalagic and bit anxious for home. But <br> after some time it will be fine I guess, I mean it has to. Will probably rush to class now.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>15:50: </b></ins></i> Came back from class. Unpacked bags, made my bed and made the room functional. Will completely unpack in subsequent days. I am <br>confused for CY 103 tutorial. I want to bath now as all sweaty and dusty.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>16:50: </b></ins></i> Came back from bath. Now it is too late for the class so will sit at my desk.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>18:02: </b></ins></i> Saw the competition for Analytics of IIT Kanput fest, no one had registered so I registered just a few minutes before closing of <br> registration. Opened IIMA prof's database then Zeeshan's post of Analyst internship at Dalberg, just congratulated him bur was surprised to know the stipend which <br> around 1 LPM.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>16:50: </b></ins></i> My laptop's sound port stopped working, checked with everything. Also I have to go repair shop and also give these sweets to <br>Devender Sir.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>20:30: </b></ins></i> Just came back. First went to give sweets then to the repair shop. Then had this TPC meet during which I was standing all the <br>
time.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>21:00: </b></ins></i> Went to have dinner, it was good. Feeling quite tired now, will probably get up early in the morning.</p>





<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 74- 15th March, Wednesday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>3:20: </b></ins></i> Got up, a bit unwilling though. I was at my laptop. Did some basic WA stuff for 20 mins or so.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>4:40: </b></ins></i> Composed with first mail of Anjali Nair. Then moved on to Prof. Anirban Baneerjee. It is very time consuming and requires a lot of patience. And there may be no return in it and the whole time can get wasted.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>7:40: </b></ins></i> Had my breakfast now, otherwise will be late for class.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>10:10: </b></ins></i> Just came back from 2 classes. Will complete the pending mail to Prof. Ellapulli Vasudevan.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>10:55: </b></ins></i> Had to go to this class also, although absolutely not willing to go but attendance is very strict this semester.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>12:40: </b></ins></i> Came back, directly went to lunch. Had to complete the lab manual now by skipping CY 103 class no choice though.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>13:21: </b></ins></i> Couldn't complete the whole lab but very close to the last experiment it will do this time.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>16:10: </b></ins></i> Got free from lab early and tutorial got cancelled so basically I can work now.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>18:50: </b></ins></i> Got extremely stressed after seeing the teams message on Invest India group. He was asking update on report. I have done nothing on <br>it. It caused panic, I was already stressed due to assignment deadlines and figma work that I have to unwillingly do and I have been slow in DSA. So, the best <br>thing to do was to walk away from it and make myself alive. I rushed downstairs walked a bit, had deep breaths. Got updated on my deadlines- asked Pinku to <br>send me the drawings, Rahul on explo, and Ashwani on group project.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>19:40: </b></ins></i> After doing all of this, thought of having dinner and then continuing.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>20:30: </b></ins></i> Had dinner, completed the figma work, filled the form for TPR, submitted Drawing layout and slept.</p>






<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 75- 16th March, Thrushday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>3:40: </b></ins></i> Got up, Pranav was already awake doing DSA, motivated me to wake up LOL. I started with DSA lectures, solved question in between but <br> followed same bogus approach of not thinking complete and coded on a vague bogus solution. This thing kills time and makes me feel like I am working hard. It is <br>stupid. It is not how things go. I should think mathematically unless I have a strong reasoning to code, don't touch the keyboard. It is tough but fruitful.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>5:30: </b></ins></i> Need to double down on DSA. Will have to draft some mails.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>7:30: </b></ins></i> Drafted 8 mails, set to go at 10 in the morning. Hoping for the best. Fingers crossed.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>7:40: </b></ins></i> Feeling hungry have my breakfast now.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>8:10: </b></ins></i> I think I can draft 1 more mail before going to class and that too to a professor.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>8:50: </b></ins></i> Scheduled the mail, ready to go to class. 75% is real now.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>12:00: </b></ins></i> Came back, had my lunch. I was very dreadful of the intern thing as had asked Prabhas to connect for the intern thing, but I had <br>thought out what to say, I know I was lying and I don't feel good about it.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>13:30: </b></ins></i> Had Environment's class now and then Drawing lab.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>14:40: </b></ins></i> Forgot laptop for Drawing lab, had to go back to hostel now.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>15:40: </b></ins></i> It's surprising, he let us go after explaining assignment 5 and 6.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>17:10: </b></ins></i> Had to go to Environment lab to complete my individual project.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>18:10: </b></ins></i> Wrapped it up very fast.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>21:20: </b></ins></i> Had my dinner and slept.</p>





<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 76- 17th March, Friday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>3:30: </b></ins></i Got up, wasted a bit of time in YT.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>5:10: </b></ins></i> Drafting last set of mails for this week.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>7:20: </b></ins></i> Completed and scheduled them, will have my breakfast now.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>11:10: </b></ins></i> Feeliing tired, in a dire need of nap.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>12:35: </b></ins></i> It got stretched, will have my lunch now.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>14:32: </b></ins></i> Had to take care of this explo thing.  I asked them no one had done anything. Asked Chetan to help, he is also a noob we couldn't <br>do it in time so dropped the plan of meeting mam.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>15:52: </b></ins></i> Did some SQL questions as bored with DSA.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>18:12: </b></ins></i> Now will revise my DSA notes.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>20:20: </b></ins></i> Time to have dinner.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>21:40: </b></ins></i> Time to sleep.</p>
    
    

<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 77- 18th March, Saturday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>3:50: </b></ins></i> Got up, sat at my laptop. Started with Russia Ukraine war updates. I needed to update the website but due to some combination of <br>keys, the tab closed and I had to write everything again wasting time.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>4:30: </b></ins></i> Finally done with updating the website, now I can get to work.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>4:40: </b></ins></i> Started with DSA lectures.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>5:45: </b></ins></i> Got distracted, opened YT started watching JEE topper talks, then moved on to funny videos. Half hour wasted.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>6:15: </b></ins></i> Started back with DSA lectures.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>7:10: </b></ins></i> Tried to login to my Invest India account, but got locked out it seems. It is again and again showin passwork used many a times. <br> Quite frustrating. Then googled this issue, doesn't seems a fix there. So generated a random password and it worked.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>7:45: </b></ins></i> I am going to have my breakfast, will go to library now. There is lot of negative energy in the room. Change of place will do good.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>8:20: </b></ins></i> After logging in I started scraping data from the ODOP teams and important phone No. and emails. Going to library now.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>11:02: </b></ins></i> Continued with my lectures and a lot of people are coding here, seems frightening though with such tough competition. We have been <br>called to TPO, agenda was Carrer Developement Programme (CDP). Seems interesting concept before internships.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>12:05: </b></ins></i> Feeling very hungry now.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>13:15: </b></ins></i> Started back.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>18:30: </b></ins></i> Quite bored now, might head to hostel anytime.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>19:00: </b></ins></i> Left libraryCame to the hostel, it was a bit raining. Washed myself a bit.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>19:30: </b></ins></i> Came to the hostel, it was a bit raining. Washed myself a bit. Will have my dinner ASAP.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>21:20: </b></ins></i> Sleep time.</p>
    
    
    
    

    
    

<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 77- 19th March, Sunday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>3:40: </b></ins></i> Got up. Started with lectures.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>5:40: </b></ins></i> The time limit for daily download was over for mega file, so it denied access for 3 hours. So thought of reading from notebook, lot <br>of material to be read.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>6:20: </b></ins></i> Wasted time on YT reels. Then tried meditating a bit.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>7:50: </b></ins></i> Wasted time on YT, but also tried to study but no major output. Went to have breakfast.</p>   
<p><i><ins><b>8:30: </b></ins></i> Came to the library, it was closed. But opened after some time.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>12:05: </b></ins></i> Did some good work. Bored in the end so reading Konark's bhaiya's blog.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>12:10: </b></ins></i> Came back to have lunch.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>12:37: </b></ins></i> A little tired so will take a nap.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>13:40: </b></ins></i> Woke up, although alarm was 20 minutes earlier, will bathe now.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>14:40: </b></ins></i> Back to library.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>17:33: </b></ins></i> Good work, just had to go to LC once, as Aniket bhaiya asked regarding Secy elections of Sports Council.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>18:00: </b></ins></i> Went to LC, for some time he pitched. Quite poor pitch indeed. Then had ice cream, absolutely shit. People are enjoying having <br>fun. I am not very much interested. Heading back to library.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>19:20: </b></ins></i> Started back with lectured after watcing a Shark Tank episode.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>20:35: </b></ins></i> I am on lec 29 anyhow, can't complete till lec 39 so no need to rush. Will head back to hostel and draft mails and finish this <br> Invest India doc and scrapping.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>21:10: </b></ins></i> Just updated the website tip top. Uff!!. Going to the hostel now.</p>
    
    
    
 
    
    

<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 79- 21st March, Tuesday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>4:20: </b></ins></i> Got up, brushed. Started with LinkedIN post unfortunately. Then moved on to mailings.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>6:17: </b></ins></i> Fed up with mailings. Then moved on DSA lectures.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>7:57: </b></ins></i> Time to rush for the class. It is a 2 hour class.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>10:40: </b></ins></i> CY 103 class cancelled as Prof. had a class at the same time, but 30 mins wasted in this. Came to library and Wi-fi is not supporting. Asked Shiv to give hotspot, it worked fine.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>13:00: </b></ins></i> I really want to complete sorting, but I guess it won't be possible. I mean then I will miss my lunch which I don't want to. I need <br> to leave now, otherwise I'd be late for the class. It is geotechnical class and after that I have environmental.</p>   
<p><i><ins><b>16:00: </b></ins></i> Got free from the classes. Had tea at LC. Then came back to library. Need to do some bogus clerical work.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>16:30: </b></ins></i> Ready for the last lecture and then sorting would be complete.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>18:10: </b></ins></i> I have to go to SAC to cast my vote. Then do the biometric verification, then get charger from room and head back straight to <br> TPO as processes are going on.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>18:45: </b></ins></i> Did all of the things. Came to TPO. Kanishk was already there. Had a little chat.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>19:30: </b></ins></i> The process started it is GD today in online mode. There are total 14 candidates. It might get late.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>9:00: </b></ins></i> Raining heavily and it is still pending. I have to take my dinner too.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>9:50: </b></ins></i> Finally it is over. Now will have my dinner and sleep. I had a meeting with Vaibhav bhaiya regarding internships guide.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>10:40: </b></ins></i> Just chatting in Dhruv's room for some time. Time to sleep.</p>
    
    
    
    
    

<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 80- 22nd March, Wednesday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>6:00: </b></ins></i> Got up around 1 hour late from alarm, was tired after proctoring duty. Brushed and sat the table.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>7:40: </b></ins></i> Absolutely didn't wanted to write any mails but I am have done that much now it si difficult to go back. Had my breakfast, didn't go <br> to class as proxy was possible in it.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>9:40: </b></ins></i> Completed my work updates doc for Invest India, modified the code somehow and  mailed it to Prabhas. Finally everything is over <br>now. Although I asked him to connect again to discuss future prospects.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>10:40: </b></ins></i> Also done with the food adulteration project. So I have no work pending now. Have to go to the class now.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>12:40: </b></ins></i> Came back from the class, had my lunch. I had asked Prabhas to connect and he had replied so saw it, and had a brief chat. I asked <br> about the future prospects. It ended well, feeling a bi t tired so will have a nap of 20 minutes till next class.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>14:40: </b></ins></i> Environment's Midsem answer sheets are being shown in the lab, then had to go to see transport's also.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>15:40: </b></ins></i> Saw both the answer sheets, I am screwed in both of them like by a big margin. In Environment got 13/45 average around 16 and <br>highest is 31. I couldn't solve both the numericals, which I solved last night. It would have fetched me lot of marks. I don't why I couldn't solve it. I just <br>really want to know</p>
<p><i><ins><b>16:30: </b></ins></i> Need to go to explo now, couldn't study much. Mind very much distracted.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>17:30: </b></ins></i> Explo went well like obviously we had done the work.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>19:00: </b></ins></i> It is TPRs interview's time. I need to go, because everyone would be punctual.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>21:00: </b></ins></i> It got over. I went back to hoste as there was no meaning going to library. So went to hostel and had my dinner.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>22:00: </b></ins></i> Sitting in Swastik's room, went there for assignment then just chit chatting there. General things nothing specific.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>22:10: </b></ins></i> Nimish called regarding CDP meet. I didn't wanted to take as Ankit said he would take, but he was not in the hostel so asking to go
<br>to common hall, but most of them writing assgnment and unwilling to go. I checked the deadline and it is today night so I had to take it. Lot of people came and <br> and everyone was seriously listening. After it got over, received praises for my speech and confidence. I also had to fill all forms.</p>

<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 81- 23rd March, Thrushday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>5:20: </b></ins></i> Unwillingly got up.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>7:00: </b></ins></i> Almost done with assignment 6. Will do remaining questions in class, just read about quiz.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>8:40: </b></ins></i> Time to go to class.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>11:00: </b></ins></i> Came back from class, quiz was good I guess.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>12:20: </b></ins></i> Unconciously started mailing and thinking. Luckily got 2 replies at similar times. Just got pumped, finally something good to   <br>see after days of disappointment and failure. Finally something is working, I might get it without calling. I really think I can. I am super pumped.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>13:20: </b></ins></i> Oops it is quite late of class. I need to have my lunch too.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>15:20: </b></ins></i> It is not proper lab class as he has taken attendance and allowed us to go. I am worried about the building plan. So, I will not rush<br> to hostel. Went to Central Office of BHU, found nothing there. They asked us to I.W.D (Institue Works dept.), found map there but it was old so new <br> buildings weren't there. It was of no use to and come back that far. Disappointed came back to the dept to go to library.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>16:30: </b></ins></i> In the library tried studying, but not very productive.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>18:10: </b></ins></i> Did some pending Invest India work to make a folder.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>19:00: </b></ins></i> Did a CP question, fugured out the logic but couldn't exactly think of an approach. It could have been solved by priority queue or <br>multiset. Since I don't do regualrly so I couldn't think of multiset.</p>   
<p><i><ins><b>20:15: </b></ins></i> Time to go to hostel. Feeling sleepy.</p>




 

    
    
    
    
<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 83- 25rd March, Saturday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>4:20: </b></ins></i> Got up, brushed.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>7:45: </b></ins></i> It wasn't very prouductive, I think I should have updated the website only. It would have been better. Feeling hungry then will go <br>to the library.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>8:50: </b></ins></i> Tony called asked to come to ABLT 4 for the inaguration ceremony of Carrer Development Programme (CDP). I didn't want to go at <br> all as I don't have a purpose there. I just wanted to attend sessions and come back but I don't think it won't be possible.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>10:15: </b></ins></i> It is starting now. I have to call people to come to ABLT 4. Let's see how the lecture goes.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>11:50: </b></ins></i> It is really good, like Aditya Thakkar talked about real world, and one thing became clear resume is not everything. It was<br>
quite eye opening to know things which are not so obvious.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>13:30: </b></ins></i> It finally got over, now will go to have my lunch. Next session starts half an hour, will get back here.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>16:30: </b></ins></i> Product Analytics session was predominantly a product management session. I was not very impressed though. Now will go to a booth <br> and try to interact with HRs and alums.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>18:15: </b></ins></i> Got a T-shirt by Sprinklr after attending a quiz. Feeling very good. I have to be there only as there is no point going back.</p>   <p><i><ins><b>19:15: </b></ins></i> I was asked to go to LT 1 also for Rephrase.ai. Now is the time for Mckinsey session. Rephrase HRs were quite unhappy with us.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>22:15: </b></ins></i> The Mckinsey session is about to get over and I chatted with this amazing senior from ECE having an intern offer from NVIDIA. He <br>was himself very welcoming and willing to talk. Really felt good about it.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>19:15: </b></ins></i> Dead tired, time to sleep.</p>
    
    
    


    
    

    
<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 84- 26th March, Sunday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>8:40: </b></ins></i> Didn't wake up on time, Ankit came to wake me up. Had to report to ABLT 4 at 9 sharp.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>11:15: </b></ins></i> Initially I was in Secure Eyes workshop, quite intersting though. Started with company's marketing and then moved on to why cyber <br>security is important for everyone. Then got the news for Duetsche Bank session going on downstairs, went there. Not a very big crowd. It was amazing PPT as he was explaining the latest happenings in the DS world and how banking sector is adopting it. Then another HR gave some resume and interview tips which were also very <br>useful. But he was strict, he even asked someone to move out as he was talking.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>13:15: </b></ins></i> Just got over with Duetsche session, feeling hungry. Mastercard session is scheduled right after it.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>15:15: </b></ins></i> Lot of crowd is expected in World Quant with a lot of pizzas. I saw a lot of pizzas, had a lot of them around 5. While listening to <br>World Quant it feels that it is going to make a lot of money, but I don't seem to understand the purpose like for what reason should I acculumate this much <br>money. It is no way contributing back and also doesn't seem to have a purpose.</p>    
<p><i><ins><b>19:15: </b></ins></i> The session got over. CDP is almost over. MAS test is schedules though. Reached campus Puneet and Tanmay was thinking to give test, <br>so I also joined in. Quant was done by Puneet, LRDI by Tanmay. Verbal and Tech done by me. Verbal seemed very very tough. Like I don't even got an idea what it was <br>trying to say. Got lowest in it, in -ve. Shameful.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>22:05: </b></ins></i> Time to sleep very tired.</p>
