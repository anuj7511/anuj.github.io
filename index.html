    <h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 1- 1st January, Sunday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>18:40: </b></ins></i> Almost finished the website templates. Started in the morning continued with my taking notes for html then eventually started coding, although a lot of work needs to be done.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>19:00: </b></ins></i>I should stop this website thing and start reading some blogs</p>
<p><i><ins><b>20:29: </b></ins></i> I watched a Shark Tank episode just to feed the mind, but this is not good. It has to stop. I am thinking of reading today rather <br> than starting DSA/CP as it will all be in a loop when I come to college.
    <p><i><ins>Things accomplished: </ins></i><br>
    <ul>
    <li>Thought out the structure of website and coded it</li>
    <li>Read <a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/productivity">Sam altman's blog on productivity</a>along with his blogs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is the first day of 2023 and I have lot of new ideas which I plan to apply on myself but it's all about execution.</p>
    </p>
    <h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 2- 2nd January, Monday</i></h3>
    <p><i><ins><b>6:16: </b></ins></i> Just sat at my laptop, woke up at around 5:45, had some tea. I need to think of something to work on. Probably I'll summarise<br> articles that I read yesterday. </p>
 <p><i><ins><b>6:34: </b></ins></i> Just tried meditating a bit, it is so difficult to keep it still....</p>
<p><i><ins><b>7:10: </b></ins></i>Summarising Sam altman's blog on <a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/productivity">How to be successful</a> </p>
 <p><i><ins><b>7:10: </b></ins></i> This is taking a lot of time. Need to drop it now because it is all about execution. </p>
     <p><i><ins><b>7:50: </b></ins></i> Started with SQL from Gfg and W3. Anish texted to connect today for that SQL task. It was not free of distractions <br>
         wathed YT shorts in b/w and checked WA. Well!, it is a shame though.  </p>
      <p><i><ins><b>10:50: </b></ins></i> Connected with Anish but couldn't share screen as task was pending. Immediately after that had DPIT meet nothing <br>
          special though just discussion on design impacts if both portrait and landscape mode allowed. </p>
      <p><i><ins><b>10:50: </b></ins></i> Watched movie "Sonchiriya"for 1hr or so. </p>
      <p><i><ins><b>13:30: </b></ins></i> Continued with SQL along with my guilt of watching with the movie. </p>
      <p><i><ins><b>13:50: </b></ins></i> Bathed and had my lunch along with brief chat with Mom. </p>
      <p><i><ins><b>14:30: </b></ins></i> Read newspaper and went outside to fetch Redhu bhaiya's blanket. </p>
      <p><i><ins><b>16:40: </b></ins></i> I have to shut this laptop along with close to 200 tabs uff..... as time for train is approaching. </p>
      <p><i><ins><b>17:30: </b></ins></i> Done with cleaing of laptop, have to immediately shut it down, otherwise I will miss my train. While closing the tabs, <br>
 I realised that I have developed a very bad habit of keeping them open thinking, I will read them after. Even if I read it then also I don't close it. Probably I <br> need to learn how to let things go. Also it shows my diverse distractions/ interests that I have developed over time from corporate, business, case study, tech, <br>
biographies, documentaries. It is very easy to get exposure over lot of things but actual thing is going deep which requires PERSISTENCE, a skill which I definitely <br>need to develop. It is very easy to touch upon up until the time, it is interesting and then dropping it ALTOGETHER. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>18:40: </b></ins></i>I am but annoyed as MOM forced me wear a jacket over hoodie, it makes me uncomfortale. Train has arrived, it is probably time to<br> leave HISAR for good. In the train met this BSF jawan(a.k.a SardarJi), smiling and probably saw Yogesh Nain standing on the station but didn't find time to talk.</p>
<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 4- 3nd January, Tuesday</i></h3>
<p>Will update soon. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>7:40: </b></ins></i></p>
   <h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 4- 4th January, Wednesday</i></h3>
   <p><i><ins><b>7:40: </b></ins></i> Going to eat my breakfast. Woke up at 5:40. Read the Inter IIT PS then prepared the deck. Basically searched the PM school decks<br> because it would have taken a lot of time otherwise.</p>
   <p><i><ins><b>8:50: </b></ins></i> Now I plan to do that design of cleanliness part as I have to go to class at 9. Wanted to go in 1st class but Ankur said<br>
  he doesn't take attendance so dropped it.</p>    
   <p><i><ins><b>8:50: </b></ins></i> I had to leave now for my transportation class. Couldn't update much,  as travelling back to college.Will update after class</p>
   <p><i><ins><b>10:20: </b></ins></i> Just came back from class, Prof was good. Now I plan to update this and then probably check my SQl work, if it is working fine.</p>
 <p><i><ins><b>10:40: </b></ins></i>Just heard back from Anish regarding that SQL work, so will probably have meeting in second half. So technically I am free,will<br> do some questions on CF. </p>
 <p><i><ins><b>13:20: </b></ins></i>Feeling a bit drowsy, had my food at 12:20, fixed that SQL work to make it presentable. But the meeting with Anish blew off.</p>
 <p><i><ins><b>14:10: </b></ins></i> My solution got accepted, I probably have to rush for my lab class now. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>17:10: </b></ins></i> Just got back from the lab. It seemed a complete time waste, NOC work was also not done. Bonafide certificate I gave and also<br>
verified the mess application status, it was also pending. Now on the room no one is there and I don't have the keys. My hand gloves also got lost in lab. Uff...<br>the PAIN is never ending.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>6:40: </b></ins></i> Shit man now the sockets stopped working. I am dozing off for an hour from 17:40. Seems it would be fixed anytime soon so I am <br>in the library. It seems so good here.</p>
 <p><i><ins><b>21:43: </b></ins></i> I am feeling super hungry, probably have to leave library now, it seems I won't be able to do this CF question. Also just updated<br> the few portions above.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>21:43: </b></ins></i> Starting out with SQL now. Just had my breakfast chatted with Darshan, a bit.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>23:45: </b></ins></i> Time to sleep guys, brain has stpped working now.</p>
<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 5- 5th January, Thrusday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>5:35: </b></ins></i>I am back with a bang. Got up at 5:10, mediatated a little. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>12:25: </b></ins></i> Started with the COMMON mistakes video of Utkarsh Gupta then participated in Virtual Contest of Jan 3. Just stuck on this <br>question, figured out the logic fast. Just trying again and again, shouldn't have done that. Frustrated had to leave for breakfast. Came back tried B immediately <br>got away with logic, solved it. feeling a bit relaxed.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>12:25: </b></ins></i> Feeling very hungry. Wanted to go to mess immediately after lab but the food was not ready so thought of updating the website.<br>But just chatting, giving placement gyan seemed a waste of time though. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>17:15: </b></ins></i>I had to immediately rush to collect mini draft and chart paper for the graph. Luckily didn't have to run much Tanmay gave the mini<br> draft and Saurav arranged the graph paper. Lab was at the same place where CE-205 laboratory was there. No one had any clue regarding how to use the drafter<br> but with time, got a hold of it. NOC is still not prepared but hopefully it is made and I am happy about it. <br>
Now feeling a bit wore off but will probably start with the reviewing previously done questions.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>19:45: </b></ins></i>DPIT meeting is going on, just got up from sleeping. I should have slept after coming from lab, it would have been more productive<br>. I am waiting for the meeting to end and do the contest, I hope it increases a bit. I just need to stay calm and give output in contest. 
<br> WILL UPDATE AFTER THE CONTEST FINGERS CROSSED.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>21:45: </b></ins></i> All the excitement is gone, I am crushed and shattered. Kind of feeling sorry for my parents who had invested in me. Couldn't<br> solve even 2 questions. Need to step up the game to next level if I had to turn things around, otherwise it is over. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>21:45: </b></ins></i>Started with further topics of time and space complexity, NO ONE IS GOING TO HELP YOU SO STAND UP FOR YOURSELF. </p>
<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 6- 6th January, Friday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>5:40: </b></ins></i>Got up on time, continued with my space time complexity, but I do feel I am giving lot of time to it than it deserve, maybe I <br>should try to finish it fast. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>10:45: </b></ins></i>I am just sitting for my study session, although not very enthusiastic for opening codeforces. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>10:45: </b></ins></i>Meeting with ANISH just got over, he liked the work and will share another dataset before 1 PM probably. Not feeling very <br> prouductive today tbh. But it is not the solution anyways. Time to work super hard guys.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>13:30: </b></ins></i> Started with STL so as to remove roadblocks, if I want to use some stuff. ALSO changed the bed settings a little bit, brought <br>the quilt. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>17:03: </b></ins></i>JUST came back after meeting explo supervisor Supriya Mam. We have been asked to make a web application having soil profile on <br>location basis. She explained a little bit about it, and we have been asked to read a research paper and update her on every Friday after 4. Although I expected <br>ML project but even web dev is OK as both are impactless. ALSO rushed back again to fetch NOC. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>17:03: </b></ins></i> Wasted a little bit time on YT Shorts, had my food sitting back for another study session. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>22:05: </b></ins></i> Time to sleep, didn't feel like productive at the moment.</p>
<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 7- 7th January, Saturday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>4:45: </b></ins></i> Woke up at 4:05, meditated a little and planned for the day, I hope make it most prouductive as weekends are crucial.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>4:30: </b></ins></i>Got up at around 4:05, ideated a bit and brushed the teeth. Started with the time space complexity then quickly switched<br>STL playlist of LUV, however deviated a little bit seeing SIXER's last episode in 2x. It was not feeling I was very productive, I don't know why.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>13:53: </b></ins></i>Came back after having food. Feeling a bit less productive, need to double down. Party in SATKAR today hosted by Ajay bhaiya VP<br>. Student Gymkhana.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>14:45: </b></ins></i>Meeting for DPIT is about to get over, they are discussing some of the security vulnerabilities of the app, didn't thought there<br> are so many to break the app. Anyways would have been better if I had got it in First year, feeling a bit pressuried. I would have learned much more but it is ok.<br>
I actually found the course of GFG on the online folder shared by senior need to </p>
<p><i><ins><b>19:00: </b></ins></i>I am absolutely not feeling okay, was not able to solve this CF question and this mega folder also created problems. It has max <br>limit of 5 GB per day. Downloaded the opera browser for it's VPN but of no use. It is simply a waste of time. I don't know if I should purchase this course.<br>It's time to go to Haryana group party.</p>
<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 8- 8th January, Sunday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>11:42: </b></ins></i>OMG!! couldn't explain in words what happended yesterday night. We went to LC and almost everyone was there already. I met this<br>from CSE Siddharth from Tosham and he from Harshdeep's family surprisingly. Seemed a decent good guy. Talked on various topics, felt good. We went to Satkar <br> and eveyone sat at this table. INITIALLY started with cold drink, I obviously wanted to try for the first time. So started with little bit of Blender's Pride<br>neat, taste seemed absolutely normal and then poured more and more. After that OLD MONK, it was something very different and strong. I started feeling a <br>odd but I was still in my senses so went on and ON as no one was there to stop me. I should have stopped after that. AFter that it went off and litreally made<br>me mad. I don't remember most of the things but I didn't have my dinner and was sitting most of time outside on chair puking. It was hell of experience.</p>
<p>Then I don't remember much just people supporting me to walk and lick lemon but nothing worked. It not only wasted my time but I am still not well, maybe because<br>I have eaten nothing. I am still not in all my senses. I need to recover all of this. I need to have my lunch, maybe it will make me feel better.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>13:30: </b></ins></i>Just came back from mess, throwed away most of the food. Felt like vomitting. Talked with Dhruv and Geetesh regarding the TPR's<br>interview shit.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>17:42: </b></ins></i>I think it is the most unproductive day of the year till now, on contrary it should be most productive.Didn't accomplish a shit <br> in the whole day. Will probably give contest at 8 though.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>10:42: </b></ins></i>The contest is over. Could solve only one. 2nd one was special one, not logical just pattern based. Most of them couldn't solve.</p>
<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 9- 9th January, Monday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>5:50: </b></ins></i>Ankit's alarm rang, completely disturbed my sleep. Asked him to stop it, then slept again for another 20 mins. Finally got up at<br>at around 6. Changed my CF handle to Mum and dad's name. Solved a question, saw other's answer's to it and it was so overwhelming to see well scripted answers with <br>lot less complexity.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>10:30: </b></ins></i>Well, the week starts with a bang. Today is relativley least workload day of the week. Just came back from class of Ramadu Sir<br>Just have one more class of Biochem, infact first class of biochem.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>15:10: </b></ins></i>Just came back from BIOCHEM class, seemed very humble and nice guy. I don't know about the syllabus and stuff but I think it would <br>be good time. Now I am thinking of submitting that CF question !!</p>
<p><i><ins><b>19:10: </b></ins></i>Just a bit exhausted after this session. Probably spent whole time on problems, but from the output prespective, I don't think<br>it was productive. Started off with 1000 rating questions, couldn't solve them with that ease, also they were consuming a lot of time. Changed topics to simple "Implementation"<br>and rating to be 900. Starte from bottom solved 2, changed the order and started with moved up, which was a mistake tbh. I should have gone<br>with same order.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>19:50: </b></ins></i>Saw few people collecting mess receipts. So for refund gave it downstairs in the office. I don't want any problems this semester<br>my last semester's refund is also pending due to my own mistake. Time to eat !!!.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>21:23: </b></ins></i>Read some Russia Ukraine news, I think now it's time to do that INVEST INDIA task. It was given on Saturday and I haven't touched<br>it yet. I am thinking of presenting it tomorrow.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>00:00: </b></ins></i>It's time to sleep, a bit tired though. It is actually boring task to segregate this type of data Statewise. I am stuck on this<br> error "Cannot obtain the required interface ("IID_IColumnsInfo") from OLE DB provider "BULK" for linked server "(null)", can't solve it. I tried everything available <br> on the web but still couldn't figure it out.</p>
<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 10- 10th January, Tuesday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>5:40: </b></ins></i>Woke up, uneccessarily alarm rang completely disturbing my sleep. I continued with the last night's work. Almost completed with<br>state segregation. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>7:20: </b></ins></i >I am done with it. Feeling a little sleepy. Thinking of taking a nap, then after waking up take breakfast and go to 2 hr strucural class.<br>. I will be attending it for the first time.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>10:20: </b></ins></i> Just came back from the structural class. It seemed very easy, all the questions that were given to solve. Basic stuff that was<br> asked to solve in first semester,it's just a continuation of that. Prof seems dilligent to some extent interactive with very poor handwriting on board. Sarthak was giving answers in class but it is easy stuff, I just need to ace the exams, learn from my mistakes from last class and improvise on them because that's what brillant <br>engineers do and I want to be one of them. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>11:20: </b></ins></i>Trimmed my hair, brushed and bathed- all of this takes around 1hr !!. It's refreshing though. I need to ask Anish for the meeting <br>time to share my problem. By that time I should just complete the remaining work left.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>13:20: </b></ins></i>Suggested 12:30 for the meeting as I complteted it by 12 then had my lunch and had the meeting. He told me not to hurry that much.<br> and contact back after coming back from college to do some of the report work. Searched Qala to watch online I now need to rush to Ramadu's class.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>16:00: </b></ins></i>Just came back from classes. I should have left Devender's sir class to proxy. Had tea kachori in between and purchased bananas in between. Now I am thinking of doing CP otherwise streak would be broken. Watched "Qala" for around 30-40 mins or so.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>21:46: </b></ins></i>Lot of time has got wasted got up at 19:10 to refresh my mind as all the questions were giving TLE. Met Suyash outside, asked me to <br>explain the TPR interview process, simply waste of time. Then had to take drafter from Mihir to rushed to 6th floor but he was not there in the room, was just <br> going towards lift thought to meet Prateek regarding inter IIT but spent too much time there. Lot of undeserving people got into inter IIT. He was worried about his <br> intern. Then had dinner and spent some time in Sarthak's room, went there to ask for assignment though. I am thinking of sleeping now, don't feel like doing <br>anything.</p>
<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 11- 11th January, Wednesday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>5:27: </b></ins></i>Huh! just starting out to complete my CE-231(Transportation) assigment, otherwise it would be too late. Mom is also coming to visit <br> me today, feeling happy though. I need to do a lot of work today. Woke up at around 4:15, meditated a little, then started reading Doglapan for half an hour.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>8:47: </b></ins></i> I think it took me a lot of time to complete it, could be done in much more optimised way if time was less. Complete waste of time. <br>I barely completed it tbh. Mom's call came around 8 but suggested to go to college as it might take her some time to get back. I need to rush now as I already missed<br>my first class. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>11:30: </b></ins></i> Just returned from classes after biochem. Immediately called mum, that I am back.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>13:45: </b></ins></i> We talked this whole time but I need to leave now to have lunch and go to geo-tech lab. It felt nice. She will probably visit<br> Devender Sir. I collected my ladoos and gajarpak from her, Ummmm. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>16:10: </b></ins></i> Just got back from lab and luckily I didn't have the copy with plane white pages, but I still got the attendance. I think of roaming outside the campus with her, probably Assi ghat.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>19:10: </b></ins></i> Dropped mom, and got back. I need to urgently go to bathroom. Had to deal with some TPC stuff now. It might get out of hand.<br>Talked with Ankit reagrding the matter. Then moved to Satvik's room, I don't know why.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>21:10: </b></ins></i> Had my dinner.Came back to room, need to do some submissions otherwise streak will be broken.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>23:40: </b></ins></i> Dozing off</p>
<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 12- 12th January, Friday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>5:40: </b></ins></i> Just got up, brushed and meditated a little. I need to get down to this SQL work, that has been pending. This error wasted tons of <br> my time.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>7:40: </b></ins></i> Started at around 6, very slow initially then ramped up. Just got over with it. I am just going to have my breakfast.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>8:50: </b></ins></i> Need to rush to class rn. Just updated the website for yesterday and today.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>12:45: </b></ins></i> Came back from a class and lab, had my lunch and collected my Inter IIT tracksuits, feeling good though wearing it. Last task on <br>my mind is giving Datshin those icons but probably I will give it to him after coming back from another lab. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>14:10: </b></ins></i>Just tried to study a little bit, although not very much focussed.</p>
<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 14- 14th January, Saturday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>8:50: </b></ins></i> Got up today at 5 or so, although was supposed to get up at 3:45 but it was way too early and I was probably feeling quite grumpy at <br>that time. Just walked a little bit, stomach was also unwell. Decided what I need to accomplish today. Started with reading some blogs on CFs then started with <br>the question.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>10:50: </b></ins></i> Got up to have my breakfast otherwise it would be too late Tried questions, although not very successful, did some wrong submissions.<br>Got back and continued the grind but this time it was much less productive, feeling a bit sleey. There is this informal meet with first yearites, I am <br>thinking of attending.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>12:50: </b></ins></i> That meet thing was a big mistake, I should have never got there. It was a big mistake, just felt embarressed and insignificant<br> there from other batchmates. Best thing would have been came back after drinking tea. Also got my lunch in between, it was really nice.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>16:03: </b></ins></i> After that continued with the questions, but after doing it for 1 hour started yt video of Luv. Then attended the DPIT meet,<br>  nothing much for me. Slept for around 30 mins in between. Just updated the website. Now I am thinking of getting back to youtube.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>11:58: </b></ins></i> Just came back from Mohan's Birthday party. Went there around 8 and returned around 11. It is actually a waste of time initially <br> due to deciding of place and how to go or wait for someone who is stuck somewhere. Overall it was good. Need to recover this time tomorrow. I also had this interview<br>planned with Utkarsh bhaiya but it was not possible as I would have to miss the food. Also I have to throw a little bit of gazarpak given by mom,felt<br>.very bad about it. I am going to sleep now as I wasted time watching documnetary, I don't know why these things happen. It just pisses me off.</p>
<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 15- 15th January, Sunday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>6:30: </b></ins></i>F man just woke up. Alarm was for 5:00, Idk how it is repeating, happened yesterday also. Anyways, nothing can be done now. Just had <br>to rush to bathroom, strolled a little in the corridor. Started with the Luv's playlist because there are endless questions, that can be solved all day, but<br> learning must go on as not much time is left and being from a non-circuital branch puts me different position.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>12:05: </b></ins></i>Feeling hungry. It was ok, except in between watched this National Geographic documentary for half an hour or so. Just continued<br> with the playlist. Contest is also there today, so will do some questions, at that time.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>16:40: </b></ins></i> Slept for some time, for around 25-30 mins. Woke up, bathed brushed made bed and laced my shoes. Took around 2 hours. It is good <br> that I watched the contest timings. Less people have registered. I was just texting to some seniors for biz interviews.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>17:29: </b></ins></i> Just came back from canteen. Contest is about to start in 5-6 minutes. I dropped my 100/- in the room, almost shit scared. Although <br> found them lying on the floor. I hope to solve 2 questions in least amount of time or atleast solve 2 questions.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>20:09: </b></ins></i> Contest is for 3 hours.</p>
<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 16- 16th January, Monday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>8:54: </b></ins></i> Got up today on time at 5:40 or so. Just completed Luv playlist and moved to GFG course. Then rushed to Ramadu Sir's class at<br> around 9. For the first time in this semester sat on the first bench. It was good experience, although felt a little sleepy.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>11:20: </b></ins></i> Filled the inter IIT form. The PS is on web3 and crypto, one of the things which I don't understand at all. Updated the website.<br>I will do the icons part and TPC spreadsheet work afterwards.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>14:25: </b></ins></i> Just continued with the GFG course. Just had lunch in between. I need to go to environmental lab, probably my first lab. I am<br> thinking of having tea in between.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>17:10: </b></ins></i> Just came back from lab. Lab got over half an hour before, but stopped by E-Cell to pick up my hoodie and billa, it seems both were <br>not there as I was technically not part of E-Summit and had not paid for hoodie. Met Parth and Ashwath bhaiya there, talked up a bit then came back. The most <br>important thing on my mind now is to do TPC work, as bhaiya has already called to do it. After that I have a meet of Tehchnex Branding Team.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>19:30: </b></ins></i> Just came back from branding meet. Although it was not very productive overall, but a good way to interact. Saw Inter Hostel going <br>on. I want to be part of it but there are only limited no. of things that I can do in a day. Also it is not very rewarding.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>21:00: </b></ins></i> Just completed 350+ companies in TPC sheet. I will just have dinner and do some CP questions most probably. Remaining all the work <br> of Invest India and DPI or TPC will do tomorrow.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>23:25: </b></ins></i> Talked with MOM, had my dinner and got the news of this year's DAAD scholars from our college. Feeling very sleepy rn. See ya! </p>
<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 17- 17th January, Tuesday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>9:37: </b></ins></i> Got up today at 5:30 or so, probably half an hour after the alarm. Checked WA and then started with the GFG course. Felt a little <br>bored so started with some CP questions. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>12:30: </b></ins></i> Hungry, probably go for lunch. I probably have a class after half an hour or so.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>16:30: </b></ins></i> Just returned from 2 classes, although they were supposed to get over 1 hour before. After the class, went to see Prof. Mahendra <br> Pal to issue books from department library. Library was open but all the shelves were closed so basically it was of no use to us. Had to issue this soil <br> engineering book by Ranjan and Rao, both for explo and dept course. Unfortunately he was not available at that moment and asked us to come tomorrow post lunch. Other <br> thing was to discuss my overload of MA-202 course. Although I had filled on the portal but hadn't submitted any application regarding this. So I am skeptical that <br> I may have that course this semester and I may miss something. Things are still very unclear. I asked Rajesh Sir but, he was sometime saying yes other times <br> saying No. Also went to DOAA office to find and conclude the matter but RK Singh Sir was not there.</i></p>
<p><i><ins><b>17:00: </b></ins></i> Came back and did some questions, then had to go to ABLT-4 for dreaded test proctoring. Also ate some ladoos for the first time <br>they are more crunchy. Bad company, no timer on test no dashboard, nothing just a simple webpage. I have to even leave my tutorial class for it as delayed the <br>reponse to WA message.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>19:00: </b></ins></i> Came back and did some questions, then had to go to ABLT-4 for dreaded test proctoring. Also ate some ladoos for the first time <br>they are more crunchy. Bad company, no timer on test no dashboard, nothing just a simple webpage.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>00:00: </b></ins></i> Continued with the CP questions, but still I am not seeing the growth as expected, I don't know if it is that slow, but it is <br> surprisngly slow. I am trying to ramp it up by all means but doesn't seem to give in. Maybe I have to devote more myself to it because time is very limited and there <br>is always scope of optimisation in everything. </p>
<p>Also started with the CY 203 notes and slides so it doesn't piles up in the end and also missed this first important tutorial. </p>
