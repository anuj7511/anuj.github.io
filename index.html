    <h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 1- 1st January, Sunday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>18:40: </b></ins></i> Almost finished the website templates. Started in the morning continued with my taking notes for html then eventually started coding, although a lot of work needs to be done.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>19:00: </b></ins></i>I should stop this website thing and start reading some blogs</p>
<p><i><ins><b>20:29: </b></ins></i> I watched a Shark Tank episode just to feed the mind, but this is not good. It has to stop. I am thinking of reading today rather <br> than starting DSA/CP as it will all be in a loop when I come to college.
    <p><i><ins>Things accomplished: </ins></i><br>
    <ul>
    <li>Thought out the structure of website and coded it</li>
    <li>Read <a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/productivity">Sam altman's blog on productivity</a>along with his blogs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is the first day of 2023 and I have lot of new ideas which I plan to apply on myself but it's all about execution.</p>
    </p>
    <h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 2- 2nd January, Monday</i></h3>
    <p><i><ins><b>6:16: </b></ins></i> Just sat at my laptop, woke up at around 5:45, had some tea. I need to think of something to work on. Probably I'll summarise<br> articles that I read yesterday. </p>
 <p><i><ins><b>6:34: </b></ins></i> Just tried meditating a bit, it is so difficult to keep it still....</p>
<p><i><ins><b>7:10: </b></ins></i>Summarising Sam altman's blog on <a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/productivity">How to be successful</a> </p>
 <p><i><ins><b>7:10: </b></ins></i> This is taking a lot of time. Need to drop it now because it is all about execution. </p>
     <p><i><ins><b>7:50: </b></ins></i> Started with SQL from Gfg and W3. Anish texted to connect today for that SQL task. It was not free of distractions <br>
         wathed YT shorts in b/w and checked WA. Well!, it is a shame though.  </p>
      <p><i><ins><b>10:50: </b></ins></i> Connected with Anish but couldn't share screen as task was pending. Immediately after that had DPIT meet nothing <br>
          special though just discussion on design impacts if both portrait and landscape mode allowed. </p>
      <p><i><ins><b>10:50: </b></ins></i> Watched movie "Sonchiriya"for 1hr or so. </p>
      <p><i><ins><b>13:30: </b></ins></i> Continued with SQL along with my guilt of watching with the movie. </p>
      <p><i><ins><b>13:50: </b></ins></i> Bathed and had my lunch along with brief chat with Mom. </p>
      <p><i><ins><b>14:30: </b></ins></i> Read newspaper and went outside to fetch Redhu bhaiya's blanket. </p>
      <p><i><ins><b>16:40: </b></ins></i> I have to shut this laptop along with close to 200 tabs uff..... as time for train is approaching. </p>
      <p><i><ins><b>17:30: </b></ins></i> Done with cleaing of laptop, have to immediately shut it down, otherwise I will miss my train. While closing the tabs, <br>
 I realised that I have developed a very bad habit of keeping them open thinking, I will read them after. Even if I read it then also I don't close it. Probably I <br> need to learn how to let things go. Also it shows my diverse distractions/ interests that I have developed over time from corporate, business, case study, tech, <br>
biographies, documentaries. It is very easy to get exposure over lot of things but actual thing is going deep which requires PERSISTENCE, a skill which I definitely <br>need to develop. It is very easy to touch upon up until the time, it is interesting and then dropping it ALTOGETHER. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>18:40: </b></ins></i>I am but annoyed as MOM forced me wear a jacket over hoodie, it makes me uncomfortale. Train has arrived, it is probably time to<br> leave HISAR for good. In the train met this BSF jawan(a.k.a SardarJi), smiling and probably saw Yogesh Nain standing on the station but didn't find time to talk.</p>
<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 4- 3nd January, Tuesday</i></h3>
<p>Will update soon. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>7:40: </b></ins></i></p>
   <h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 4- 4th January, Wednesday</i></h3>
   <p><i><ins><b>7:40: </b></ins></i> Going to eat my breakfast. Woke up at 5:40. Read the Inter IIT PS then prepared the deck. Basically searched the PM school decks<br> because it would have taken a lot of time otherwise.</p>
   <p><i><ins><b>8:50: </b></ins></i> Now I plan to do that design of cleanliness part as I have to go to class at 9. Wanted to go in 1st class but Ankur said<br>
  he doesn't take attendance so dropped it.</p>    
   <p><i><ins><b>8:50: </b></ins></i> I had to leave now for my transportation class. Couldn't update much,  as travelling back to college.Will update after class</p>
   <p><i><ins><b>10:20: </b></ins></i> Just came back from class, Prof was good. Now I plan to update this and then probably check my SQl work, if it is working fine.</p>
 <p><i><ins><b>10:40: </b></ins></i>Just heard back from Anish regarding that SQL work, so will probably have meeting in second half. So technically I am free,will<br> do some questions on CF. </p>
 <p><i><ins><b>13:20: </b></ins></i>Feeling a bit drowsy, had my food at 12:20, fixed that SQL work to make it presentable. But the meeting with Anish blew off.</p>
 <p><i><ins><b>14:10: </b></ins></i> My solution got accepted, I probably have to rush for my lab class now. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>17:10: </b></ins></i> Just got back from the lab. It seemed a complete time waste, NOC work was also not done. Bonafide certificate I gave and also<br>
verified the mess application status, it was also pending. Now on the room no one is there and I don't have the keys. My hand gloves also got lost in lab. Uff...<br>the PAIN is never ending.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>6:40: </b></ins></i> Shit man now the sockets stopped working. I am dozing off for an hour from 17:40. Seems it would be fixed anytime soon so I am <br>in the library. It seems so good here.</p>
 <p><i><ins><b>21:43: </b></ins></i> I am feeling super hungry, probably have to leave library now, it seems I won't be able to do this CF question. Also just updated<br> the few portions above.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>21:43: </b></ins></i> Starting out with SQL now. Just had my breakfast chatted with Darshan, a bit.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>23:45: </b></ins></i> Time to sleep guys, brain has stpped working now.</p>
<h3><i style="background-color:white; border:2px solid black;">Day 5- 5th January, Thrusday</i></h3>
<p><i><ins><b>5:35: </b></ins></i>I am back with a bang. Got up at 5:10, mediatated a little. </p>
<p><i><ins><b>12:25: </b></ins></i> Started with the COMMON mistakes video of Utkarsh Gupta then participated in Virtual Contest of Jan 3. Just stuck on this <br>question, figured out the logic fast. Just trying again and again, shouldn't have done that. Frustrated had to leave for breakfast. Came back tried B immediately <br>got away with logic, solved it. feeling a bit relaxed.</p>
<p><i><ins><b>12:25: </b></ins></i> Feeling very hungry. Wanted to go to mess immediately after lab but the food was not ready so thought of updating the website.<br>But just chatting, giving placement gyan seemed a waste of time though. </p>
