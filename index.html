    <p><i style="border:2px solid black">8:13pm</i>. <!- - Jessica Alona is a bitch. I need to think of something to maketo takemy mind off her.- - > I need to <br> think of something to occupy my mind. Easy enoughnow I just need an idea…
    <p><i>9:48pm</i>. I’m a little intoxicated, not gonna lie. So what if it’s not even10pm andit’s a Tuesday night? What? The Kirkland facebook isopen on my <br> computer desktop and some of these people have pretty horrendous facebook pics.I almost want to put some of these faces next to pictures of farm animals and have people<br> vote on which is more attractive. It’s not such a great idea and probably not evenfunny, butBilly comes up with the idea of comparing two people from the facebook, <br> and onlysometimes putting a farm animal in there. Good call Mr. Olson! I think he’s onto something.
